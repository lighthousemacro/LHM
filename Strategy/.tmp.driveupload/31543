# What Is REALLY Driving Bitcoin's Price?

**Gun to my head, two indicators: a macro-liquidity composite and technical structure.**

One maps the tide as it flows through specific channels into crypto. The other tells you whether price is confirming or diverging from that tide. They occupy different time domains. That's the point.

### Indicator #1: The Crypto Liquidity Impulse (CLI)

Most people who talk about "liquidity driving Bitcoin" are pointing at the right ocean but tracking the wrong waves. The standard net liquidity formula (Fed balance sheet minus TGA minus RRP) is a blunt instrument. It uses levels instead of rate of change. It ignores the channels through which liquidity actually reaches crypto. And post-RRP depletion, it's structurally compromised: one of its three components is permanently near zero.

The CLI is our answer. It's a weighted composite organized across three tiers, each capturing a different layer of the liquidity impulse with a different lead time:

| Tier | What It Captures | Lead Time |
|------|-----------------|-----------|
| **Macro Tide** | Dollar momentum and its impact on global risk appetite | 6-12 months |
| **Plumbing** | Banking system reserve dynamics and trajectory | 2-8 weeks |
| **Crypto Channels** | Stablecoin vs. BTC capital rotation | 1-3 weeks |

The critical design choice: every component is measured as a *rate of change*, not a level. The headline 0.94 level-based correlation between Bitcoin and global M2 is misleading. Two things that both trend upward will always look correlated. Rate-of-change strips out that noise and isolates the actual signal.

**The results.** We backtested the CLI using a quintile sort methodology across ~2,900 daily observations from 2018-2025. The composite was built with data-driven weights, not heuristics.

| Horizon | Bottom Quintile (Q1) | Q2 | Q3 | Q4 | Top Quintile (Q5) | Spread (Q5-Q1) |
|---------|---------------------|-----|-----|-----|-------------------|----------------|
| 21 days | -4.8% | +0.5% | +1.0% | +2.0% | +8.6% | **+13.4%** |
| 42 days | -7.8% | -0.2% | +3.9% | +6.0% | +14.3% | **+22.1%** |
| 63 days | -9.8% | -2.1% | +9.0% | +11.1% | +17.2% | **+27.0%** |

All horizons are statistically significant at p < 0.0001 and the dose-response is monotonic: every step up in the index corresponds to higher forward returns. This is not noise. The t-statistic at 21 days is 14.2.

Simplified into three regimes:

| CLI Regime | Avg 63D Return | Win Rate | Slugging % |
|-------------|---------------|----------|------------|
| Contracting | -8.5% | 33% | 0.43x |
| Neutral | +6.9% | 55% | 2.06x |
| Expanding | +16.8% | 73% | 3.92x |

The slugging percentage captures what win rate alone misses: in volatile assets, the *size* of wins relative to losses matters as much as frequency. In expanding environments, wins are nearly 4x the size of losses on a risk-adjusted basis. In contracting environments, losses dominate by more than 2:1. The asymmetry is the signal.

**Current reading (Feb 2026):** Neutral. The dollar headwind and plumbing dynamics are roughly offsetting. No strong directional signal in either direction.

**Why this matters now.** Post-RRP depletion, TGA rebuilds drain bank reserves directly. There's no $2.5 trillion buffer anymore. The plumbing layer of the CLI captures this regime change. Most net-liquidity trackers haven't internalized it.

### Indicator #2: Technical Structure

If the CLI tells you what *should* happen, technical structure tells you what *is* happening.

This is straightforward CMT work, not chart astrology. Three components, in order of importance:

**Trend context: the 200-day moving average slope.** Not whether price is above or below the 200d (though that matters). The *slope* tells you whether the primary trend is accelerating, decelerating, or turning. Price making new highs above a rising 200d is the strongest structural setup. Price rallying into a falling 200d is a bear market bounce until proven otherwise.

**Momentum: the 63-day rate of change, volatility-adjusted.** Raw momentum is noisy. A 10% rally means something different when trailing volatility is 20% versus 80%. Normalizing momentum relative to recent history separates genuine trend from noise. Context is everything: overbought in an uptrend is confirmation. Overbought in a downtrend is exhaustion.

**Confirmation: relative strength.** Is BTC outperforming or underperforming the broader risk asset universe? Persistent relative underperformance is disqualifying regardless of absolute trend. When BTC is lagging equities on both intermediate and long-term timeframes, whatever is happening in stocks, it's happening harder in crypto on the downside. No longs.

**How the pairing works.** The CLI and technical structure occupy different time domains. The CLI leads by 1-12 months. Technical structure is coincident. When macro liquidity is expanding and price structure is confirming, you have conviction. When they diverge, you wait. The best setups: CLI positive, price making a multi-week high above a flat or turning 200d MA, with relative strength confirming. That's when you press.

### Honorable Mention: On-Chain Valuation

If I had a third pick, it would be on-chain valuation metrics like MVRV Z-Score, which compares market cap against the aggregate cost basis of every coin on the blockchain. Historical extremes have flagged both major cycle tops and bottoms. On-chain data occupies an information domain that neither macro liquidity nor technicals can see: where holders sit relative to their cost basis. It's genuinely useful. But it's supplementary to the two primary lenses, not a replacement for either.

### What Doesn't Work

**Stock-to-Flow.** A regression of price on a derivative of price is not a model. It's a mirror. It ignores demand entirely in a market that is, by definition, demand-driven.

**Global M2 with a Magic Lag.** The "optimal" lag varies wildly across analysts (56, 70, 84, 90, 100, 108 days have all been cited). The 180-day rolling correlation between global M2 and BTC oscillates between +0.95 and -0.90. A chart overlay is not analysis. It's decoration.

**The 4-Year Halving Cycle.** N = 3 completed cycles, each in an entirely different macro environment. Post-2024, BTC has delivered its weakest halving-epoch performance to date. The apparent pattern likely traces to a global liquidity cycle, not supply mechanics. Which brings us back to indicator #1.

**Fear & Greed Index.** A thermometer, not a forecast. It describes current conditions. Buying when it hits single digits has worked historically, but that's a contrarian signal at extremes, not a forecasting tool.

### The Honest Caveat

No Bitcoin forecasting framework has survived rigorous out-of-sample testing across more than 3-4 cycles. Every relationship documented above is conditional and time-varying. Before 2020, Fed tightening actually *increased* Bitcoin prices. After 2020, tightening *decreased* prices. The sign of the relationship flipped. If it flipped once, it can flip again.

The analyst who combines directional liquidity with technical confirmation and maintains honesty about regime change will outperform the one chasing precise M2 overlays or halving countdowns.
