## Executive Summary

Lighthouse Macro's trading strategy combines systematic regime identification with disciplined position sizing to generate alpha at macro inflection points. The framework measures rather than predicts. It concentrates when conviction is high rather than diversifying for safety.

### Core Differentiation

| **Attribute** | **Lighthouse Approach** | **Consensus Approach** |
|---------------|-------------------------|------------------------|
| **Signal Source** | 12 Macro Pillars → Proprietary Indicators | Headlines, lagging data |
| **Position Sizing** | Conviction-weighted (7-20% per position) | Equal-weighted |
| **Concentration** | 3-5 high-conviction bets | 30+ marginal positions |
| **Cash Treatment** | Active position (30-100% valid) | Residual drag |
| **Risk Framework** | Dual stops (thesis + price) | Single trailing stop |
| **Timeframe** | 3-6 month tactical core | Arbitrary calendar |

### The Edge

**Flows > Stocks.** We measure labor market deterioration 6-9 months before unemployment rises. We track Fed plumbing stress before funding markets break. We identify credit complacency before spreads widen. We see structure break before fundamentals confirm. By the time everyone knows, the move is over. That's the window where we operate.

---

## I. Investment Philosophy

### Regime-Based Concentration

**Core Principles:**

**1. Regimes Matter More Than Assets**

Asset class returns are regime-dependent. A bull market in equities under abundant liquidity (LCI > 0) behaves fundamentally differently than a bull market under scarce liquidity (LCI < -0.5). Identifying regime shifts earlier is where alpha comes from.

**2. Position Sizing is Alpha**

Risk management matters more than instrument selection. The difference between 7% and 20% position sizing on a correct call is the difference between marginal and exceptional performance. Bet size reflects signal strength, not equal-weighting.

**3. Simplicity Over Complexity**

Implement with liquid instruments (ETFs, futures, spot). Avoid exotic structures for complexity's sake. Most blowups start with options leverage. Simple execution with proper sizing wins over time.

**4. Dual Risk Framework**

Every framework-driven position carries two invalidation criteria:
- **Thesis-based stops:** Fundamental regime change (e.g., LFI drops below 0.5)
- **Price-based stops:** Technical structure breaks (e.g., 50d MA < 200d MA)

Use whichever triggers first. Preserve capital.

**5. Flows > Stocks**

Leading indicators (quits rate, RRP flows, funding spreads) beat lagging indicators (unemployment, GDP). Position ahead of data confirmation. The honest signal is always in the flows.

---

## II. One Book, Two Ways of Taking Risk

The portfolio is a single book. The distinction is what drives a given position.

### Framework-Driven (most of the book)

Macro thesis plus fundamental confirmation plus technical entry. Long or short. Sizing up to 20% per position via the Tier system. The MRI regime multiplier scales mechanically. Catalyst horizon 3-6 months. Cash is a position. This is the engine that earns over a full cycle.

Every framework-driven position has a thesis and an invalidation, and uses dual stops (thesis or price, whichever triggers first).

### Technical Sleeve (humility patch)

Pure trend, momentum, or relative strength. No thesis required. Smaller positions, tighter stops. No thesis stop because there is no thesis. Just price.

The sleeve exists because markets do not owe the framework anything. When the framework is defensive (MRI elevated, regime multiplier compressed) but clear technical trends exist in the tape, capital should not sit fully idle. The sleeve participates in pure technical setups while the framework-driven book stays defensive on the macro view.

When the framework re-engages (MRI improves), positions in the sleeve that meet framework criteria can graduate to the framework-driven book. The two should not compete for the same capital. When the framework is fully active, the sleeve is small or inactive.

**Public language note:** Don't cite "framework-driven sleeve" / "technical sleeve" / "humility patch" in published copy until the first PiTrade is live.

## III. The Macro Foundation: Connecting to the 12 Pillars

Our trading framework doesn't exist in isolation. It's the **execution layer** of the 12 Macro Pillars (The Diagnostic Dozen). Every position traces back to a pillar signal.

### Pillar-to-Trade Mapping

| **Pillar Signal** | **Trading Expression** | **Asset Class** |
|-------------------|------------------------|-----------------|
| LFI > +0.8 | Reduce cyclical equity exposure | Equities |
| LCI < -0.5 | Reduce gross exposure, add cash | All |
| CLG < -1.0 | Add credit protection (HY short) | Credit |
| PCI > +1.0 | Short duration, inflation hedges | Rates |
| GCI-Gov > +1.0 | Steepener trades, term premium | Rates |
| BCI < -0.5 | Underweight small caps vs large | Equities |
| HCI < -0.5 | Avoid homebuilders, housing-sensitive | Equities |
| MSI < -0.5 | Reduce gross exposure | All |
| SPI > +1.5 | Contrarian fade (crowding risk) | All |

### Current Pillar State

Live readings for all 12 pillar composites flow from the daily indicator pipeline (`/Users/bob/LHM/Scripts/data_pipeline/`). The MRI synthesizes them into the regime multiplier that scales position sizes.

---

## IV. The Three-Engine Analytical Framework

Every trade must pass through the integrated three-engine framework. Single-engine signals are insufficient. High-conviction positioning requires **convergence across engines**.

### Engine 1: Macro Dynamics (Pillars 1-7)

**Focus:** Labor, Prices, Growth, Housing, Consumer, Business, Trade

**Key Insight:** Flows precede stocks. Labor market deterioration shows up in quits rate and hires/quits ratio 6-9 months before unemployment rises. The transmission chain runs: Labor → Income → Spending → Profits.

**Primary Indicators:**

| **Indicator** | **Threshold** |
|---------------|---------------|
| Quits Rate | < 2.0% = pre-recessionary |
| Long-Term Unemployed | > 22% = fragility |
| Hires/Quits Ratio | < 2.0 = demand weakening |
| Temp Help YoY | < -3% = recession signal |
| Core PCE | > 2.5% = elevated |
| ISM Manufacturing | < 48 = recession |

The Labor Pressure Index (LPI) and Labor Fragility Index (LFI) summarize the labor inputs. Above +0.5 on LFI is the elevated band; above +1.0 is high; above +1.5 is critical.

### Engine 2: Monetary Mechanics (Pillars 8-10)

**Focus:** Government (Fiscal), Financial (Credit/Conditions), Plumbing (Liquidity)

**Key Insight:** RRP exhaustion removes the system's shock absorber. Treasury issuance drains reserves directly when the buffer is gone. The regime where fiscal policy overwhelms monetary policy is fiscal dominance, and term premium is the price of admission.

**Primary Indicators:**

| **Indicator** | **Threshold** |
|---------------|---------------|
| RRP Balance | < $200B = buffer gone |
| Reserves vs LCLOR | < $300B = scarcity |
| EFFR-IORB Spread | > +8 bps = stress |
| SOFR-IORB Spread | > +10 bps = funding stress |
| Deficit/GDP | > 5% = elevated |
| Term Premium | > +50 bps = repricing |

### Engine 3: Market Technicals (Broad Market Diagnostics)

**Focus:** Breadth, internals, volatility regime, cross-asset correlations

**Key Insight:** This is the health check on the *environment*, not the individual position. Breadth measures reveal internal market health that headline indices obscure. When the S&P 500 makes new highs but only 40% of stocks are above their 50d MA, the generals are marching without the troops. You can have a perfect setup on an individual asset, but if the broad market is deteriorating underneath, the tide will eventually pull everything down.

**Breadth Diagnostics & Conditional Forward Returns:**

We track breadth metrics and then ask: given where we are *now*, what do forward returns historically look like? The current reading frames the conditional.

| **Diagnostic** | **Current Reading** | **Condition** | **Forward Returns (Historical)** |
|----------------|---------------------|---------------|----------------------------------|
| % Stocks > 20d MA | [Live] | < 30% (washed out) | Next 20d: +2.1% avg, 68% win rate |
| | | > 80% (crowded) | Next 20d: +0.3% avg, 52% win rate |
| % Stocks > 50d MA | [Live] | < 35% (washed out) | Next 63d: +4.8% avg, 71% win rate |
| | | > 85% (crowded) | Next 63d: +1.2% avg, 55% win rate |
| % Stocks > 200d MA | [Live] | < 45% (bear regime) | Next 126d: bifurcated, either recovery or acceleration |
| | | > 75% (bull regime) | Next 126d: +6.2% avg, but elevated drawdown risk |
| % Stocks at 63d High | [Live] | < 3% (no leadership) | Next 20d: watch for breadth thrust or continued deterioration |
| | | > 20% (broad breakout) | Next 63d: momentum tends to persist |
| % Stocks at 63d Low | [Live] | > 20% (capitulation) | Next 20d: mean reversion probable, +2.8% avg |
| | | < 2% (complacent) | Next 20d: low vol drift, but vulnerable to shock |
| New Highs - New Lows | [Live] | < -300 for 3+ days | Next 20d: oversold bounce typical |
| | | > +300 for 5+ days | Next 63d: breadth thrust, historically bullish |
| SPX Drawdown | [Live] | Down >5% over 10d | Next 20d: mean reversion +1.9% avg |
| | | Down >10% over 20d | Next 63d: +5.4% avg, but wide distribution |

*Note: Historical returns are illustrative baselines from backtesting. Actual figures updated in production dashboards.*

**The Framework:**
```
1. Observe current breadth reading
2. Look up historical forward returns for that condition
3. Calibrate aggression accordingly
```

This isn't prediction. It's base rates. If % stocks > 50d MA is at 28% right now, history says forward 63-day returns average +4.8% with 71% win rate. Doesn't mean it *will* rally, but the odds favor leaning in. We use this to size positions and set expectations, not to make binary bets.

**Volatility & Positioning:**

| **Indicator** | **Threshold** |
|---------------|---------------|
| VIX | < 15 = complacent, > 25 = fear |
| VIX Term Structure | contango = calm, backwardation = fear |
| HY OAS | < 300 bps = complacent |
| Equity-Bond Correlation | > +0.3 = diversification breaking |

**Diagnostic Use Case:** Breadth divergences often lead price by 2-4 weeks. Conditional return analysis helps calibrate *how much* to lean into or against the current setup. When indices are rising but breadth is deteriorating, reduce position sizes and tighten stops. The foundation is cracking even if the roof looks fine.

---

### Position-Level Technicals (The Actual Trade)

**Focus:** The specific asset's trend, momentum, structure, and relative strength

**Key Insight:** This is completely separate from broad market diagnostics. Engine 3 tells you *whether* to be aggressive or defensive. Position-level technicals tell you *what* to buy and *when* to buy it. A stock can be in a perfect uptrend while the broad market is deteriorating (defensive sector, relative strength leader) or vice versa (cyclical garbage rallying into a weakening tape).

**The 3-Panel Chart:**

| **Panel** | **What It Shows** | **Decision** |
|-----------|-------------------|--------------|
| **Panel 1: Price & Trend** | Price, 50d MA, 200d MA | Is the trend intact? |
| **Panel 2: Relative Strength** | Asset/Benchmark ratio with 63d & 252d MAs | Is it outperforming? |
| **Panel 3: Momentum (Z-RoC)** | Z-scored rate of change | Is momentum confirming? |

**Position-Level Checklist (Before Any Entry):**

| **Element** | **Requirement** | **Fail = No Trade** |
|-------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| Price vs 200d MA | Price > 200d MA | ❌ Absolute Rule #1 |
| 50d vs 200d MA | 50d > 200d (no death cross) | ❌ Absolute Rule #2 |
| MA Direction | Both MAs rising (not flat/declining) | ⚠️ Reduced conviction |
| Relative Strength | Green panel (outperforming benchmark) | ❌ Absolute Rule #3 |
| Z-RoC | > -1.0 (momentum not broken) | ❌ Exit signal if held |
| Extension | Within 15% of 50d MA | ❌ Absolute Rule #5 |

**The Interaction:**

```
BROAD MARKET (Engine 3)          POSITION TECHNICALS
        ↓                                ↓
   Environment                     Specific Setup
        ↓                                ↓
  "Should I be aggressive       "Is THIS asset ready
   or defensive overall?"         to buy right now?"
        ↓                                ↓
   Regime Multiplier             Conviction Score
        ↓                                ↓
        └──────────────┬─────────────────┘
                       ↓
               POSITION SIZE
```

**Example:** Broad market breadth is deteriorating (Engine 3 = Warning), but XLV (Healthcare) is in a perfect uptrend with rising relative strength (Position Technicals = Strong). You still take the trade, but the deteriorating environment reduces your regime multiplier. A Tier 1 setup that would get 20% in a healthy tape gets 12% in a deteriorating one.

## VI. Position Sizing & Conviction Framework

### The Regime-Conviction-Size Formula

```
Position Size = Regime_Multiplier × Conviction_Weight × Liquidity_Adjustment
```

**Components:**

1. **Regime Multiplier** (0.0x to 1.2x): Set by MRI
2. **Conviction Weight** (0% to 20%): Set by Conviction Tier
3. **Liquidity Adjustment** (0.5x to 1.0x): Asset-specific

### Conviction Scoring System

**Total Possible: 19 points**
- Technical Score: 0-9 pts
- Fundamental Score: 0-5 pts
- Microstructure Score: 0-5 pts

#### Technical Score Components (0-9 pts)

**1. Primary Trend (0-2 pts)**

| **Condition** | **Score** |
|---------------|-----------|
| Price > 50d > 200d, both MAs rising | 2 pts |

| **Regime** | **MRI** | **Multiplier** | **Conviction** | **Size** |
|------------|---------|----------------|----------------|----------|
| Low Risk | -0.6 | 1.2x | 20% | 24% |
| Neutral | +0.3 | 1.0x | 20% | 20% |
| Elevated | +0.8 | 0.6x | 20% | 12% |
| High Risk | +1.2 | 0.3x | 20% | 6% |
| Crisis | +1.8 | 0.0x | 20% | 0% (cash) |

## VII. The Perfect Setup: Anatomical Breakdown

The Perfect Setup is the **only configuration** that justifies maximum position sizing. Everything else is partial position or pass.

### The Six-Element Configuration

**Element 1: Primary Trend Structure**
- Price > 50d MA
- 50d MA > 200d MA
- **Both MAs rising** (not just aligned, but ascending)
- Non-negotiable. Flat or declining MAs = skip.

**Element 2: Relative Trend Alignment**
- Asset outperforming benchmark (Panel 2 = Green)
- Relative price > Relative 63d MA > Relative 252d MA
- No exceptions. Relative downtrend = not interested.

**Element 3: Consolidation Pattern**
- **Sideways price action** for 10-30 days after prior uptrend leg
- **Volatility compression** (ATR declining during consolidation)
- Price oscillating around rising 50d MA but not breaking below
- Volume declining during consolidation (lack of distribution)

**Element 4: Momentum Behavior During Consolidation**
- Z-RoC was strong (+1.0 to +2.0) leading into consolidation
- Z-RoC cooled to -0.5 to +0.5 during consolidation
- **Key:** Momentum dissipated but didn't collapse (never hit -1.0)
- **Interpretation:** Buyers took a breather. Sellers didn't show up.

**Element 5: Breakout Trigger**
- Price breaks above consolidation range
- Z-RoC crosses back above 0 (momentum resuming)
- Ideally bouncing off or near rising 50d MA
- Volume expansion on breakout (commitment signal)

**Element 6: Macro Regime Confirmation**
- MRI not in Crisis territory (< +1.5)
- LCI not critically scarce (> -1.0)
- No acute funding stress signals

### Visual Recognition

```
Price Action (Top Panel):
  - Rising blue 200d MA (steady upward slope)
  - Rising red 50d MA (steeper slope than 200d)
  - Price consolidating horizontally around 50d MA for 2-3 weeks
  - Then: Price breaks up, 50d continues rising

Relative Strength (Middle Panel):
  - Filled GREEN throughout
  - Relative price oscillating but staying above both relative MAs
  - No breakdown signals

Z-RoC Momentum (Bottom Panel):
  - Came from +1.5 range (prior leg up)
  - Cooled to +0.2 during consolidation (buyers rested)
  - Never dropped below -0.5 (sellers didn't take control)
  - Now turning back up through 0 (momentum resuming)
```

**This is the only setup we truly load up on.**

## VIII. Absolute Rules: Non-Negotiable Filters

Before any trade consideration, these filters must pass. If any fail, the trade doesn't happen.

### Rule 1: Never Own Below 200d MA

**Logic:** Below 200d = long-term downtrend or broken structure

**No Exceptions:** Not for "value," not for "oversold," not for "turnaround story"

**Why:** Statistical edge evaporates in long-term downtrends

### Rule 2: Never Own When 50d < 200d (Death Cross)

**Logic:** Short-term momentum counter to long-term trend = danger zone

**Visual:** Red MA below blue MA = automatic pass

**Why:** This configuration precedes most major declines

### Rule 3: Never Own a Relative Downtrend

**Logic:** If asset underperforming benchmark, you're in wrong asset

**Visual:** Panel 2 shows red/magenta = automatic pass

**Why:** Opportunity cost. Capital is better deployed in relative leaders.

### Rule 4: Never Add to Losers

**Logic:** Averaging down violates trend-following philosophy

**Why:** Catching knives vs. riding rockets. We choose rockets.

### Rule 5: Never Chase Above +15% Extension from 50d MA

**Logic:** Parabolic moves mean revert violently

**Exception:** Can hold existing position with trailing stop, but no new entry

### Rule 6: Never Fight the Macro Regime

**Logic:** MRI > +1.5 = Crisis = no new equity longs regardless of setup quality

**Why:** Regime overwhelms individual setup quality

## IX. Asset Class Framework & Implementation

### Core Portfolio (90% of Capital)

**1. U.S. Equities (40-70%)**
- Primary: SPY (S&P 500 ETF)
- Alternatives: VTI (Total Market), QQQ (Nasdaq), sector tilts
- Futures: ES (E-mini S&P 500) for tactical overlays

**2. U.S. Bonds (20-50%)**
- Primary: AGG (Aggregate Bond), TLT (Long Duration)
- Alternatives: SHY (Short Duration), IEF (Intermediate)
- Futures: ZN (10-Year Notes), ZB (Long Bond)

**3. Cash (0-30%)**
- Primary: SGOV (Short-term T-bills), money market
- **Active position, not residual.** 100% cash is valid when MRI > +1.5.

### Tactical Overlays (10% of Capital, Rotational)

| **Asset** | **Allocation** | **Vehicle** | **Use Case** |
|-----------|---------------|-------------|--------------|
| Gold | 0-10% | GLD, GC futures | Crisis hedge, real rate hedge |
| Commodities | 0-10% | DBC, CL futures | Inflation hedge |
| International | 0-15% | VEA, VWO | Diversification, rotation |
| Sector Tilts | 0-20% | XLU, XLP, XLV (defensive) | Late-cycle positioning |
| Volatility | 0-5% | VXX, TAIL | Tail risk hedging |
| Crypto | 0-10% | BTC, ETH, spot ETFs | Liquidity cycle beta |

### Instrument Selection: Futures vs ETFs

**Use Futures When:**
- Position > $500,000 (cost advantage dominates)
- Any leverage required (ETF borrowing costs punitive)
- Short positions (stock borrow costs avoided)
- Holding period 3-6 months (roll costs manageable)
- International investor (dividend withholding avoided)

**Use ETFs When:**
- Position < $100,000 (operational simplicity)
- Unleveraged long only
- Tax-advantaged accounts (no mark-to-market)
- Assets lacking liquid futures (sectors, thematics)

### Cost Comparison (3-Month Hold)

| **Asset** | **Futures Cost** | **ETF Cost** | **Advantage** |
|-----------|-----------------|--------------|---------------|
| S&P 500 | ~3 bps | ~5.8 bps | Futures +2.8 bps |
| 10-Year Treasury | ~2 bps | ~8 bps | Futures +6 bps |
| Gold | ~4 bps | ~14 bps | Futures +10 bps |
| Crude Oil | Variable | 125-375 bps* | Futures (massive) |

*Futures-based commodity ETFs suffer severe contango drag

## X. Tactical Timeframe Optimization

### The 3-6 Month Tactical Sweet Spot

Research across 80+ years of market data reveals that the 3-6 month horizon represents a "Goldilocks zone":

| **Timeframe** | **GDP Forecast Error** | **Momentum Persistence** | **Verdict** |
|---------------|------------------------|--------------------------|-------------|
| < 1 month | N/A | +1.0 Sharpe | Noise, high turnover |
| 1-3 months | ±1.5 ppts | +0.9 Sharpe | Event-driven overlay |
| **3-6 months** | **±2.0 ppts** | **+0.8 Sharpe** | **Optimal tactical** |
| 6-12 months | ±2.2 ppts | +0.5 Sharpe | Signal decay |
| > 12 months | ±2.6 ppts | Reversal risk | Mean reversion |

### The Magic Number: Formation + Holding = 14-18 Months

For 3-month tactical positions: Use 9-12 month lookback
For 6-month tactical positions: Use 6-12 month lookback

**The 12-14 Month Danger Zone:** Momentum-to-mean-reversion transition. Exit or reverse by month 12-14.

### Three-Layer Position Architecture

**Layer 1: Core Strategic-Tactical (60-70% of risk budget)**
- Holding period: 3-6 months
- Adjustment frequency: Monthly to quarterly
- Signal source: MRI, LFI, LCI regime changes
- Current example: 40% equity / 45% bonds / 15% cash (MRI +1.1 defensive)

**Layer 2: Tactical Intermediate (20-30% of risk budget)**
- Holding period: 1-3 months
- Adjustment frequency: Weekly to monthly
- Signal source: Relative strength rotation, sector momentum
- Current example: Overweight XLV (healthcare), underweight XLF (financials)

**Layer 3: Event-Driven Overlays (10-20% of risk budget)**
- Holding period: 1-3 weeks
- Adjustment frequency: Event-triggered
- Signal source: FOMC, data releases, liquidity stress

### Event-Driven Positioning: The FOMC Trade

**Pre-FOMC Equity Drift (49 bps average, 1.14 Sharpe):**
- Days -10 to -5: Establish 5-10% long equity position
- Day -1 (24 hours before): Scale to 15-20%
- Day 0 (announcement): Exit 75-100% at or before 2:15pm

**Post-FOMC Treasury Drift (120+ bps over 50 days):**
- Day 0 (post-announcement): Establish 10-15% duration position
- Day 20: Scale to 20% if drift confirms
- Day 45-50: Exit before mean reversion begins

**Annual Opportunity:** 8 FOMC meetings × (49 bps equity + 100 bps bonds) = 400-800 bps gross potential

---

## XI. Risk Management Framework

### Position Limits (Hard Limits, Never Exceed)

| **Limit Type** | **Maximum** |
|----------------|-------------|
| Single position | 30% |
| Sector concentration | 40% |
| Gross exposure | 100% (no leverage) |
| Minimum liquidity | 5% (for rebalancing) |
| Correlated positions (ρ > 0.7) | Combined < 40% |

### Drawdown Protocols

| **Drawdown Level** | **Action** |
|-------------------|-----------|
| -5% | Review positioning, tighten stops, confirm thesis |
| -10% | Reduce gross exposure 25%, increase cash |
| -15% | Cut to minimum (20-30% equity), maximum defense |
| -20% | Emergency reassessment, potential strategy pause |

### Dual Stop-Loss Framework

**1. Thesis-Based Stops (Fundamental Invalidation)**

Exit when regime indicators reverse:
- LFI drops below 0.0 (labor stabilizing)
- Quits rate rises above 2.1% (confidence returning)
- Fed announces emergency liquidity intervention
- Credit spreads widen > 500 bps (stress already priced)
- MRI drops below +0.5 (risk normalizing)

**2. Price-Based Stops (Technical Invalidation)**

Exit when technical structure breaks:
- 50d MA crosses below 200d MA (trend broken)
- Relative strength breaks support (rotation signal)
- Stop-loss triggered (-5% to -10% depending on volatility)
- Z-RoC < -1.0 (momentum breakdown)

**Rule: Use whichever stop triggers first.**

### Rebalancing Protocol

**Threshold-Based (Not Calendar-Based):**
- Monitor: Biweekly (every 10 trading days)
- Trigger: 20% relative tolerance band breach
- Example: 50% target → rebalance at 40% or 60%
- Benefit: +55 bps annual vs no rebalancing, +22 bps vs annual calendar

**Signal-Driven Triggers:**
- MRI crosses threshold (+0.5, +1.0, +1.5)
- Any absolute rule violation
- Correlation spike > 2σ from average

---

## XII. Implementation Workflow

### Morning Routine (06:30 - 07:30 ET)

**1. Macro Regime Check (10 min)**
- Update LCI (RRP, reserves, TGA)
- Check stablecoin supply delta (7d, 30d)
- Review MRI composite
- **Determine:** Supportive (1.0x) / Neutral (0.6x) / Restrictive (0.3x)

**2. Portfolio Health Check (10 min)**

For each position, verify:
- [ ] Price still > 50d > 200d?
- [ ] Relative panel still green?
- [ ] Z-RoC still > -1.0?
- [ ] No absolute rule violations?

**Action:** If any fail, mark for review/exit

**3. Opportunity Scan (20 min)**

Screen for:
- Price > 50d > 200d (both rising)
- Relative panel green
- Z-RoC between -0.5 and +1.5 (not broken, not euphoric)
- Recent consolidation near 50d MA (10-30 days)

**Result:** 3-5 candidates for deeper analysis

**4. Deep Dive Analysis (10 min per candidate)**
- Pull up 3-panel chart
- Score Technical (0-9), Fundamental (0-5), Microstructure (0-5)
- Calculate composite, assign tier
- Check Perfect Setup elements (6-point checklist)

**Result:** Ranked list with position size targets

### Weekly Review (Sunday Evening, 60 min)

**1. Position Rescore (30 min)**
- Recalculate conviction scores for all positions
- Check for 25%+ drift from target size
- Update stops based on new structure

**2. Framework Calibration (15 min)**
- Review win/loss ratio past week
- Check if stops are too tight/loose (> 40% stopped out = too tight)
- Assess if regime classification accurate

**3. Opportunity Pipeline (15 min)**
- Review candidates that didn't qualify
- Note any approaching Perfect Setup configurations
- Set alerts for Z-RoC crosses, breakout levels

### Monthly Deep Dive (First Sunday, 2 hours)

**1. Performance Attribution (45 min)**
- Which setups worked? (Perfect Setup vs others)
- Which regime classification was accurate?
- Any rule violations? (did we break absolute rules?)

**2. Framework Refinement (30 min)**
- Should conviction tier thresholds adjust?
- Are momentum thresholds valid for current volatility regime?
- Any systematic errors in scoring?

**3. Macro Outlook Update (45 min)**
- Deep dive all 12 pillar composites
- Fed policy trajectory assessment
- Update regime probability distribution (next 3 months)

## XIII. Crypto-Specific Considerations

### Benchmark Selection Hierarchy

**Tier 1: BTC as Universal Default (80% of positions)**

Use for: L1 competitors, infrastructure, store-of-value alternatives, cross-chain protocols

**Rationale:** BTC is the liquidity anchor. If an asset can't beat BTC, why hold it?

**Tier 2: ETH for Ethereum Ecosystem (15% of positions)**

Use for: L2s (ARB, OP), DeFi protocols (UNI, AAVE), ETH-denominated assets

**Rationale:** These are leveraged bets on Ethereum's success. Primary benchmark = ETH, secondary check = BTC.

**Tier 3: Sector Indices (5% of positions)**

Use for: Sector rotation strategies with 10+ positions

**Practical recommendation:** Skip this for concentrated portfolios.

### Crypto Position Sizing Adjustments

**Liquidity Adjustment:**
- BTC, ETH: 1.0x (fully liquid)
- Top 10 by market cap: 0.9x
- Top 11-50: 0.7x
- Top 51-100: 0.5x
- Outside Top 100: 0.3x or avoid

**Volatility Adjustment:**
- Crypto positions should generally be sized 40-60% of equivalent conviction equity positions
- Example: Tier 1 equity = 20%, Tier 1 crypto = 8-12%

### Crypto Instrument Selection

**Use Spot ETFs (IBIT, FBTC, BITB) When:**
- 3-6 month tactical horizon
- Tax-advantaged accounts
- Simplicity preferred
- All-in cost: 9-33 bps for 3 months

**Use Spot (Direct Holdings) When:**
- Longer holding periods
- Self-custody preference
- Access to DeFi yield

**Avoid Perpetual Futures Unless:**
- Very short-term (< 1 week)
- Funding rates neutral to negative
- Running dedicated short-term technical book

## XIV. The Psychological Edge: Trusting the Framework

The hardest part isn't calculating scores. It's following the rules when your gut screams otherwise.

### Scenario 1: Missing the Moonshot
- Asset you passed on runs +200%
- **Framework Response:** How many wrong setups did you avoid? One winner doesn't validate ignoring rules.
- **Action:** Log the miss, analyze if scoring was wrong or luck.

### Scenario 2: Stopped Out at the Bottom
- Entry at $100, stopped at $92, asset rallies to $130 next week
- **Framework Response:** Stop protected capital when thesis in question.
- **Action:** If setup re-qualifies, re-enter. Don't regret risk management.

### Scenario 3: Watching from Sidelines in Restrictive Regime
- MRI elevated, 80% cash, market rips 15%
- **Framework Response:** Regime filter exists for inevitable reversal.
- **Action:** Wait for regime shift confirmation before deploying.

### Scenario 4: The Perfect Setup That Fails
- All 6 elements align, 20% position, drops -12% to stop
- **Framework Response:** 50-60% win rate means 40-50% fail. This is expected.
- **Action:** Check if setup truly met criteria. If legit, accept and move on.

**The Edge:** Most traders abandon their system after 2-3 losses. We trust ours through 40-50 losses knowing the 50-60 wins compound harder.

---

## Closing: The Edge is in the Discipline

We've built a framework that combines:
- **Macro overlay** (12 Pillars → MRI regime filter)
- **Technical precision** (trend + momentum + structure + relative strength)
- **Systematic scoring** (removes emotion from conviction assessment)
- **Absolute rules** (prevents mistakes that blow up accounts)

But here's the truth: **None of this works if you don't follow it.**

The market will show you a thousand reasons to override the rules:
- "This one's different"
- "I have special information"
- "Rules are for other people"

Every overridden rule is a deposit in the account of regret. Every followed rule, even when painful, is compounding discipline.

You don't need to be smarter than the market. You need to be more disciplined than your past self.

**That's the only edge that matters.**
