# PILLAR 5: CONSUMER

## The Consumer Transmission Chain

The consumer isn't a sector—it's **68% of GDP**. The transmission mechanism operates through cascading confidence and credit dynamics:

```
Employment Security → Income Growth → Confidence →
Spending Decisions → Credit Usage → Retail Sales →
Corporate Revenue → Hiring Decisions →
Employment Security (Reinforcing Loop)
```

**The Insight:** The consumer is a **lagging indicator pretending to be coincident**. By the time retail sales collapse, labor already cracked 6-9 months prior. The consumer is the last domino—the one that confirms the recession everyone else saw coming.

The beauty of consumer data: it's **high frequency** (weekly credit card data, monthly retail sales) but **backward-looking** (spending decisions reflect confidence formed months ago). The consumer tells you where the economy was, not where it's going. For that, watch labor and credit.

---

## Why Consumer Matters: The 68% Anchor

Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) is the **largest GDP component by far**. When the consumer sneezes, GDP catches pneumonia.

**The Cascade:**

**1. Consumer → GDP:** PCE is 68% of output (coincident)
**2. Consumer → Corporate Earnings:** Revenue = consumer spending (1-2 quarter lag)
**3. Consumer → Labor:** Hiring follows sales (2-4 month lag)
**4. Consumer → Credit:** Spending drives loan demand (coincident)
**5. Consumer → Inflation:** Demand-pull inflation from excess spending (3-6 month lag)

Get the consumer call right, and you've anchored your GDP forecast. Miss it, and you're guessing at 68% of the economy.

**Current State:** The consumer is exhibiting **exhaustion without collapse**. Spending growing +2.1% real YoY but decelerating. Savings rate depleted to 4.5% (pre-pandemic: 7.5%). Credit card delinquencies at 3.0% (highest since 2012). This isn't strength. This is a consumer running on fumes, spending down savings and racking up debt to maintain lifestyle. That works until it doesn't.

## Primary Indicators: The Complete Architecture

### A. SPENDING FLOWS (The Core Signal)

Spending is the output variable—what consumers actually do. Track it at multiple frequencies and decompositions.

| **Indicator** | **FRED Code** | **Frequency** | **Lead/Lag** | **Interpretation** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE)** | PCE | Monthly | Coincident | Total consumer spending (nominal) |
| **Real PCE** | PCEC96 | Monthly | Coincident | Inflation-adjusted spending |
| **PCE: Goods** | DGDSRA3A086NBEA | Monthly | Coincident | Durable + nondurable goods |
| **PCE: Durable Goods** | PCDG | Monthly | **Leads services 2-4 mo** | Big-ticket items (cars, appliances) |
| **PCE: Nondurable Goods** | PCND | Monthly | Coincident | Consumables (food, gas, clothing) |
| **PCE: Services** | PCESV | Monthly | Lagging 1-2 mo | 65% of PCE (healthcare, housing, dining) |
| **Retail Sales** | RSXFS | Monthly | Coincident | Goods-focused spending |
| **Retail Sales ex-Autos** | RSFSXMV | Monthly | Coincident | Strips volatile component |
| **Retail Sales: Control Group** | RSSM4413NUSS | Monthly | Coincident | Core retail (GDP proxy) |
| **Real Retail Sales** | Derived | Monthly | Coincident | Deflated by CPI |

#### Derived Spending Metrics

| **Metric** | **Formula** | **Threshold** | **Signal** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Real PCE YoY%** | Current - Year Ago | <1.5% | Stagnation |
| **Real PCE Momentum** | 3M Ann - 12M Ann | <-1 ppt | Deceleration |
| **Goods/Services Spread** | Goods YoY - Services YoY | <-3 ppts | Goods weakness (cyclical warning) |
| **Real Retail Sales YoY%** | Nominal - CPI YoY | <0% | Volume contraction |
| **Control Group Momentum** | 3M Avg - 6M Avg | <-0.5% | Trend deterioration |

#### Regime Thresholds: Spending

| **Indicator** | **Contraction** | **Stagnation** | **Normal** | **Boom** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Real PCE YoY%** | <0% | 0-1.5% | 1.5-3.0% | >3.0% |
| **Real Retail Sales YoY%** | <-1% | -1% to +1% | +1% to +4% | >+4% |
| **Durable Goods PCE YoY%** | <-5% | -5% to +2% | +2% to +8% | >+8% |
| **Services PCE YoY%** | <1% | 1-2% | 2-4% | >4% |

**The Durables Canary:** Durable goods spending is the **most cyclical** PCE component. Consumers defer big-ticket purchases when confidence drops. Durables peaked at +32% YoY (April 2021, post-COVID surge) and are now at **-1.8% YoY** (Dec 2025)—contracting. Services at +2.4% YoY, holding up. Classic late-cycle: discretionary collapses first.

---

### B. INCOME & SAVINGS (The Fuel Tank)

Spending requires income or savings drawdown. When both are depleted, spending stops.

| **Indicator** | **FRED Code** | **Frequency** | **Lead/Lag** | **Interpretation** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Personal Income** | PI | Monthly | Coincident | Total income (wages, transfers, dividends) |
| **Disposable Personal Income (DPI)** | DPI | Monthly | Coincident | After-tax income |
| **Real DPI** | DSPIC96 | Monthly | Coincident | Inflation-adjusted income |
| **Wages & Salaries** | A576RC1 | Monthly | Coincident | Largest income component (~60%) |
| **Personal Saving** | PSAVE | Monthly | Coincident | DPI - PCE |
| **Personal Saving Rate** | PSAVERT | Monthly | **Leading 3-6 mo** | Savings as % of DPI |
| **Real DPI Per Capita** | A229RX0 | Monthly | Coincident | Living standards gauge |
| **Transfer Payments** | A063RC1 | Monthly | Coincident | Government support (SS, UI, welfare) |

#### Derived Income/Savings Metrics

| **Metric** | **Formula** | **Threshold** | **Signal** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Real DPI YoY%** | Current - Year Ago | <1.5% | Purchasing power squeeze |
| **Saving Rate Gap** | Current - Pre-Pandemic Avg (7.5%) | <-3 ppts | Savings depleted |
| **Income-Spending Gap** | Real DPI YoY - Real PCE YoY | <-1 ppt | Spending exceeds income (unsustainable) |
| **Wage Growth Real** | Wage YoY - CPI YoY | <0% | Real wage erosion |
| **Transfer Dependency** | Transfers / Personal Income | >20% | Fiscal dependency elevated |

#### Regime Thresholds: Income & Savings

| **Indicator** | **Stressed** | **Stretched** | **Normal** | **Flush** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Personal Saving Rate** | <3.5% | 3.5-5.5% | 5.5-8.0% | >8.0% |
| **Real DPI YoY%** | <0% | 0-2% | 2-4% | >4% |
| **Real Wage Growth** | <-1% | -1% to +1% | +1% to +2% | >+2% |
| **Excess Savings Stock** | <$0 | $0-$500B | $500B-$1T | >$1T |

**The Savings Depletion:** Personal saving rate at **4.5%** (Dec 2025)—down from pandemic peak of 32% (April 2020) and pre-pandemic normal of 7.5%. The **excess savings** accumulated during COVID (~$2.1T) are now **fully depleted** as of Q3 2025 (SF Fed estimate). Consumers are no longer spending down savings—they're living paycheck-to-paycheck again. Next stop: credit.

---

### C. CONSUMER CREDIT (The Accelerant and the Warning)

When savings run out, consumers turn to credit. Rising credit = spending maintained. Rising delinquencies = trouble ahead.

| **Indicator** | **FRED Code** | **Frequency** | **Lead/Lag** | **Interpretation** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Consumer Credit Outstanding** | TOTALSL | Monthly | Coincident | Total consumer debt (ex-mortgage) |
| **Revolving Credit (Credit Cards)** | REVOLSL | Monthly | Coincident | Short-term, high-rate debt |
| **Nonrevolving Credit** | NONREVSL | Monthly | Coincident | Auto loans, student loans |
| **Credit Card Delinquency Rate** | DRCCLACBS | Quarterly | **Leading 3-6 mo** | Early stress signal |
| **Auto Loan Delinquency Rate** | DRALTACBS | Quarterly | Coincident | Big-ticket stress |
| **Consumer Loan Delinquency Rate** | DRCCELOBS | Quarterly | Coincident | Broad consumer stress |
| **Credit Card Interest Rate** | TERMCBAUTO48NS | Monthly | Coincident | Borrowing cost |
| **Credit Card Balances** | NY Fed (web) | Quarterly | Coincident | Revolving debt outstanding |

#### Derived Credit Metrics

| **Metric** | **Formula** | **Threshold** | **Signal** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Credit Growth YoY%** | Current - Year Ago | >10% | Unsustainable acceleration |
| **Revolving/Nonrevolving Ratio** | Revolving / Nonrevolving | >0.35 | Credit card dependency high |
| **Delinquency Trend** | Current DQ - Year Ago | >+0.5 ppt | Stress building |
| **Debt Service Ratio** | Debt Payments / DPI | >10% | Stretched capacity |
| **Credit Impulse** | Change in Credit Growth YoY | <-3 ppts | Credit tightening |

#### Regime Thresholds: Consumer Credit

| **Indicator** | **Crisis** | **Stressed** | **Normal** | **Healthy** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Credit Card Delinquency** | >5.0% | 3.5-5.0% | 2.5-3.5% | <2.5% |
| **Auto Delinquency** | >3.0% | 2.0-3.0% | 1.5-2.0% | <1.5% |
| **Credit Growth YoY%** | <0% or >12% | 0-3% or 8-12% | 3-6% | 6-8% |
| **Debt Service Ratio** | >12% | 10-12% | 8-10% | <8% |

**The Credit Card Stress:** Credit card delinquency at **3.0%** (Q3 2025)—highest since 2012, up from 1.5% low (2021). Credit card balances at **$1.17T**—record high. Average credit card APR at **22.8%**—record high. Consumers borrowed to maintain lifestyle as savings depleted. Now the bills are coming due. This is **Stage 2** of consumer stress (Stage 1: savings depletion, Stage 2: credit stress, Stage 3: spending collapse).

---

### D. CONSUMER CONFIDENCE (The Psychological Driver)

Confidence surveys measure **expectations**—what consumers plan to do, not what they've done. They lead spending by 1-3 months but are noisy and subject to partisanship.

| **Indicator** | **Source** | **Frequency** | **Lead/Lag** | **Interpretation** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Conference Board Consumer Confidence** | Conf Board | Monthly | **Leads spending 1-3 mo** | Headline sentiment |
| **CB: Present Situation** | Conf Board | Monthly | Coincident | Current conditions |
| **CB: Expectations** | Conf Board | Monthly | **Leads recession 6-9 mo** | Future outlook (key signal) |
| **UMich Consumer Sentiment** | UMich | Monthly | Leads spending 1-2 mo | Alternative sentiment gauge |
| **UMich: Current Conditions** | UMich | Monthly | Coincident | Present assessment |
| **UMich: Expectations** | UMich | Monthly | Leading 2-4 mo | Forward-looking |
| **UMich: Buying Conditions (Durables)** | UMich | Monthly | **Leads durables 1-3 mo** | Big-ticket intentions |
| **Bloomberg Consumer Comfort** | Bloomberg | Weekly | Coincident | High-frequency pulse |

#### Derived Confidence Metrics

| **Metric** | **Formula** | **Threshold** | **Signal** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Expectations-Present Spread** | Expectations - Present Situation | <-25 | Future pessimism (recession signal) |
| **Confidence Momentum** | Current - 6M Avg | <-10 | Rapid deterioration |
| **UMich-CB Divergence** | UMich Index - CB Index | >±15 | Unusual divergence |
| **Buying Conditions Gap** | Current - Historical Avg | <-20 | Demand destruction |

#### Regime Thresholds: Confidence

| **Indicator** | **Recessionary** | **Weak** | **Normal** | **Strong** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **CB Consumer Confidence** | <75 | 75-95 | 95-120 | >120 |
| **CB Expectations** | <70 | 70-85 | 85-105 | >105 |
| **UMich Sentiment** | <65 | 65-80 | 80-100 | >100 |
| **Expectations-Present Spread** | <-30 | -30 to -15 | -15 to +5 | >+5 |

**The Expectations Collapse:** Conference Board Expectations at **78** (Dec 2025)—below the **80 threshold** that historically precedes recessions. Present Situation at **138**—still robust. The spread is **-60**, signaling that consumers feel okay today but expect deterioration ahead. This divergence has preceded every recession since 1970 by 6-12 months.

---

### E. LABOR INCOME PROXY (The Paycheck Reality)

The consumer's spending capacity ultimately derives from employment and wages. Track aggregate payroll income as the fundamental driver.

| **Indicator** | **FRED Code** | **Frequency** | **Lead/Lag** | **Interpretation** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Aggregate Weekly Payrolls** | Derived | Monthly | Coincident | Employment × Hours × Wages |
| **Average Hourly Earnings** | CES0500000003 | Monthly | Coincident | Wage rate |
| **Average Weekly Hours** | AWHAETP | Monthly | **Leads payrolls 2-4 mo** | Hours worked |
| **Total Private Employment** | USPRIV | Monthly | Coincident | Job count |
| **Real Average Hourly Earnings** | Derived | Monthly | Coincident | Wage purchasing power |
| **Quits Rate** | JTSQUR | Monthly | **Leads income 6-9 mo** | Worker confidence in alternatives |

#### Derived Labor Income Metrics

| **Metric** | **Formula** | **Threshold** | **Signal** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Aggregate Payroll Growth YoY%** | Emp × Hours × Wages YoY | <3% | Income stagnation |
| **Real Payroll Growth** | Nominal Payroll Growth - CPI | <0% | Real income declining |
| **Hours Contribution** | Hours YoY × Weight | <0% | Intensive margin contracting |
| **Wage Contribution** | Wages YoY × Weight | <3% | Wage growth fading |

#### Regime Thresholds: Labor Income

| **Indicator** | **Contraction** | **Stagnation** | **Normal** | **Strong** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Aggregate Payroll YoY%** | <0% | 0-3% | 3-5% | >5% |
| **Real Payroll YoY%** | <-2% | -2% to +1% | +1% to +3% | >+3% |
| **Hours Growth YoY%** | <-1% | -1% to +1% | +1% to +2% | >+2% |
| **Real AHE YoY%** | <0% | 0-1% | 1-2% | >2% |

**The Income Squeeze:** Aggregate weekly payrolls growing at **+3.8% YoY** nominal, but CPI at 2.8%, so **real aggregate income +1.0% YoY**—barely positive. Average weekly hours at 34.3 (flat), employment growth decelerating (+140k/month vs +200k in 2024), wage growth slowing (3.9% vs 4.5% in 2024). The tailwind is fading.

---

### F. HIGH-FREQUENCY SPENDING (The Real-Time Pulse)

Credit card data and alternative sources provide **weekly or even daily** spending reads—essential for nowcasting.

| **Indicator** | **Source** | **Frequency** | **Lead/Lag** | **Interpretation** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Bank of America Card Spending** | BofA | Weekly | Real-time | Total card spending (60M households) |
| **Chase Card Spending** | JPM | Weekly | Real-time | Alternative card data |
| **Redbook Retail Sales** | Redbook | Weekly | Coincident | Retail chain sales |
| **Johnson Redbook YoY%** | Redbook | Weekly | Coincident | Year-over-year comparison |
| **Restaurant Reservations (OpenTable)** | OpenTable | Daily | Coincident | Dining demand proxy |
| **TSA Checkpoint Data** | TSA | Daily | Coincident | Travel demand |
| **Box Office Revenue** | Box Office Mojo | Weekly | Coincident | Entertainment spending |
| **Gasoline Demand** | EIA | Weekly | Coincident | Driving activity |

#### Derived High-Frequency Metrics

| **Metric** | **Formula** | **Interpretation** |
|---|---|---|
| **Card Spending vs 2019** | Current / 2019 Level × 100 | Recovery benchmark |
| **Card Spending Momentum** | 4-wk Avg vs 13-wk Avg | Trend direction |
| **Discretionary/Staples Ratio** | Discretionary Spending / Staples | Consumer confidence proxy |
| **Travel vs Pre-Pandemic** | TSA / 2019 TSA × 100 | Travel normalization |

#### Regime Thresholds: High-Frequency

| **Indicator** | **Weak** | **Stable** | **Strong** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Card Spending YoY%** | <2% | 2-6% | >6% |
| **Redbook YoY%** | <3% | 3-6% | >6% |
| **TSA vs 2019** | <95% | 95-105% | >105% |
| **Restaurant Reservations vs 2019** | <90% | 90-105% | >105% |

**The Spending Slowdown:** Bank of America card data shows spending **+2.8% YoY** (Dec 2025)—still positive but decelerating from +5.2% (Dec 2024). Discretionary categories (electronics, apparel, restaurants) growing slower than staples (groceries, utilities). Consumers are **trading down**, not trading up. The composition shift tells the story.

---

### G. CONSUMER BALANCE SHEET (The Capacity Gauge)

The consumer's ability to spend depends on net worth (assets minus liabilities). Wealthy consumers spend more freely. Stressed consumers pull back.

| **Indicator** | **FRED Code** | **Frequency** | **Lead/Lag** | **Interpretation** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Household Net Worth** | BOGZ1FL192090005Q | Quarterly | Lagging 1-2 qtrs | Total assets - liabilities |
| **Household Net Worth / DPI** | Derived | Quarterly | Lagging | Wealth-to-income ratio |
| **Household Debt / DPI** | HDTGPDUSQ163N | Quarterly | Lagging | Leverage ratio |
| **Household Debt Service Ratio** | TDSP | Quarterly | Coincident | Payment burden |
| **Financial Obligations Ratio** | FOR | Quarterly | Coincident | Broader payment burden |
| **Home Equity** | Z.1 Flow of Funds | Quarterly | Lagging | Housing wealth |
| **Stock Holdings** | Z.1 Flow of Funds | Quarterly | Lagging | Equity wealth |

#### Derived Balance Sheet Metrics

| **Metric** | **Formula** | **Threshold** | **Signal** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Net Worth YoY%** | Current - Year Ago | <0% | Wealth destruction |
| **Debt/Income Trend** | Current Ratio - 5Y Avg | >+10 ppts | Leverage building |
| **Debt Service Burden Change** | Current DSR - Year Ago | >+1 ppt | Strain increasing |
| **Home Equity / Mortgage Debt** | Equity / Mortgage | <30% | Underwater risk |

#### Regime Thresholds: Balance Sheet

| **Indicator** | **Stressed** | **Stretched** | **Normal** | **Strong** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Household Debt / DPI** | >110% | 95-110% | 80-95% | <80% |
| **Debt Service Ratio** | >13% | 11-13% | 9-11% | <9% |
| **Net Worth / DPI** | <600% | 600-750% | 750-850% | >850% |
| **Home Equity Share** | <20% | 20-35% | 35-50% | >50% |

**The Wealth Bifurcation:** Aggregate household net worth at **$160T** (Q3 2025)—near record highs. But distribution is severely skewed: top 10% hold 67% of wealth. Bottom 50% have **negative net worth** on average. The "strong consumer" is the wealthy consumer. The median consumer is stressed. Aggregate data masks the bifurcation.

---

### H. CONSUMER SEGMENTS (The Distributional Reality)

Not all consumers are equal. Income quintiles, age cohorts, and asset ownership create vastly different spending capacities.

| **Segment** | **Characteristics** | **Current State** | **Spending Signal** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Top Quintile (>$150k income)** | Stock-heavy wealth, low debt burden | Strong (+4% spending YoY) | Holding up economy |
| **Middle Quintiles ($50-$150k)** | Home equity wealth, some debt | Stretched (+1% spending YoY) | Trading down |
| **Bottom Quintile (<$50k)** | No wealth buffer, high debt/income | Stressed (-1% real spending YoY) | Cutting back |
| **Millennials (28-43)** | Peak earning years, high housing costs | Mixed (+2% spending YoY) | Housing cost pressure |
| **Gen Z (18-27)** | Entry-level wages, high student debt | Stressed (+0% real spending YoY) | Paycheck-to-paycheck |
| **Boomers (60-78)** | Retiring, drawing down assets | Stable (+2% spending YoY) | Social Security anchor |

#### Segment-Specific Metrics

| **Metric** | **Formula** | **Threshold** | **Signal** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Bottom 50% Real Spending YoY%** | Segment-specific | <0% | Broad-based stress |
| **Prime-Age Spending Growth** | 25-54 cohort YoY | <1% | Core economy weak |
| **Luxury/Discount Spending Ratio** | Luxury category / Discount category | <0.8 | Trading down |
| **Buy Now Pay Later Usage** | BNPL volume YoY | >30% | Credit desperation |

**The K-Shaped Consumer:** The top quintile is spending +4% YoY on travel, dining, luxury. The bottom quintile is cutting groceries. The **aggregate** +2.1% real PCE masks this bifurcation. Watch segment-level data and the "trading down" phenomenon (Walmart gains, Target loses) for the true consumer picture.

## Consumer Pillar Composite Index (CCI)

### Formula

The Consumer Pillar Composite synthesizes spending, income, credit, and confidence into a single consumer health indicator:

```
CCI = 0.25 × z(Real_PCE_YoY)
    + 0.20 × z(Personal_Saving_Rate)
    + 0.15 × z(Retail_Sales_Control_YoY)           # RSXFS (card spending proxy)
    + 0.10 × z(-Credit_Card_Delinquency)            # Inverted (high DQ = weak)
    + 0.10 × z(UMich_Sentiment)                     # Proxy for CB Expectations
    + 0.10 × z(Real_DPI_YoY)
    + 0.10 × z(-Debt_Service_Ratio)                 # Inverted (high DSR = weak)
```

**Component Weighting Rationale (validated via backtest, Feb 2026):**
- **Real PCE (25%):** The output variable. Highest forward correlation with own trajectory (-0.82 at 12M)
- **Saving Rate (20%):** Fuel tank gauge. Second-highest predictive power (+0.50 at 12M)
- **Retail Sales Control (15%):** High-frequency spending confirmation via RSXFS (Census). Third-most predictive (-0.50 at 12M). Replaces proprietary card spending data (not publicly available)
- **Credit Card Delinquency (10%):** Stress signal (inverted). Economically important but low empirical forward correlation (-0.11). Kept for structural logic
- **UMich Sentiment (10%):** Confidence proxy for CB Expectations (not on FRED). Downweighted from original 15% due to increasing partisan noise post-2016
- **Real DPI (10%):** Income driver of spending capacity
- **Debt Service Ratio (10%):** Balance sheet strain (inverted). Low forward correlation but captures mechanical repricing dynamics

**Weight validation:** Backtested against forward 6M and 12M PCE outcomes (2008-2025). Blended approach: 60% economic logic + 40% empirical correlation. See `/Users/bob/LHM/Scripts/chart_generation/cci_backtest.py` for full analysis.

### Interpretation

| **CCI Range** | **Regime** | **Discretionary Allocation** | **Signal** |
|---|---|---|---|
| > +1.0 | Consumer Boom | Overweight discretionary, travel | Full expansion |
| +0.5 to +1.0 | Healthy | Neutral discretionary | Sustainable growth |
| -0.5 to +0.5 | Neutral/Fatigued | Slight underweight discretionary | Deceleration |
| -1.0 to -0.5 | Stressed | **Underweight discretionary, overweight staples** | Demand destruction |
| < -1.0 | Crisis | Maximum defensive (staples, discount) | Recession confirmed |

### Historical Calibration

| **Period** | **CCI** | **Regime** | **Outcome (12M Forward)** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Dec 2006** | +0.3 | Neutral | Consumer held through 2007, collapsed 2008 |
| **Dec 2007** | -0.4 | Stressed | Deep consumer recession confirmed |
| **Dec 2011** | +0.2 | Neutral | Slow recovery underway |
| **Dec 2019** | +0.7 | Healthy | Pre-COVID strength |
| **Dec 2020** | +0.5 | Healthy | Stimulus-fueled spending |
| **April 2021** | +1.8 | Boom | Peak stimulus, max spending |
| **Dec 2023** | +0.4 | Neutral | Savings depleting |
| **Dec 2025** | **-0.3** | **Fatigued** | **Stage 2 stress (credit)** |

**Current Assessment (Feb 2026):** CCI at **-0.39** places the consumer in "Neutral/Fatigued" regime—not collapsing, but running on fumes:
- **Real PCE at +2.1% YoY** (positive but decelerating)
- **Saving rate at 4.5%** (below 5.5% stress threshold)
- **Credit card delinquency at 3.0%** (highest since 2012)
- **CB Expectations at 78** (below 80 recession threshold)
- **Real DPI at +1.2% YoY** (barely keeping pace with spending)
- **Debt service ratio at 10.8%** (elevated but not crisis)

The consumer hasn't cracked yet. But the cracks are visible.

```

**The Critical Chain:**

**1. Labor deteriorates** (quits fall, claims rise) → 6-9 months later → **Income growth slows**
**2. Income slows + savings depleted** → 1-3 months later → **Credit usage spikes**
**3. Credit stress builds** (delinquencies rise) → 3-6 months later → **Spending cuts begin**
**4. Spending contracts** → 1-2 quarters later → **Corporate revenues fall → Layoffs → Reinforcing loop**

We're currently between Steps 2 and 3. Savings depleted. Credit stress emerging. Spending hasn't cracked yet.

## Integration with Three-Engine Framework

### Pillar 5 → Pillar 1 (Labor)

Consumer spending drives **labor demand** through corporate revenue:

```
Consumer Spending ↓ → Corporate Revenue ↓ →
Profit Margins Squeezed → Cost Cutting ↓ →
Hiring Freeze → Layoffs → Income ↓ → Spending ↓ (Reinforcing)
```

**Current Linkage:** Real PCE at +2.1% YoY (decelerating). Corporate profit growth slowing. S&P 500 earnings revisions turning negative. Hiring already slowing (payrolls +140k vs +200k last year). The transmission is underway.

**Cross-Pillar Signal:** When **CCI < -0.3** (consumer fatigued) AND **LFI > +0.8** (labor fragile), recession probability exceeds 65% within 12 months. Current: **CCI -0.39, LFI +0.93**. **Warning threshold engaged.**

---

### Pillar 5 → Pillar 2 (Prices)

Consumer demand drives **inflation** through demand-pull dynamics:

```
Consumer Spending ↑ → Demand Exceeds Supply →
Pricing Power ↑ → Inflation ↑
Consumer Spending ↓ → Demand Falls → Pricing Power ↓ → Inflation ↓
```

**Current Linkage:** Consumer spending decelerating (+2.1% real, down from +3.5% in 2024). Goods demand particularly weak (-1.8% durables). This is **disinflationary** for goods prices (already -1.2% CPI). Services inflation stickier (wage-driven).

**Cross-Pillar Signal:** Consumer weakness (**CCI -0.39**) supports the "last mile" inflation resolution. If spending cracks further, services inflation will follow goods down. PCI likely to fall from +0.7 to +0.4 over next 6 months if consumer continues to fade.

### Pillar 5 → Pillar 3 (Growth)

Consumer is **68% of GDP**—the dominant growth driver:

```
Consumer Spending Growth → PCE Contribution to GDP →
GDP Growth → Investment Response → Hiring → Consumer Income (Reinforcing)
```

**Current Linkage:** PCE contributing **+1.4 ppts** to GDP (+2.5% total). If consumer slows to +1.5% real, PCE contribution falls to +1.0 ppts. GDP falls to ~2.0%. If consumer stagnates (+0.5%), GDP falls to ~1.0%. Consumer is the margin.

**Cross-Pillar Signal:** When **CCI < -0.5** (consumer stressed) AND **GCI < -0.5** (growth contracting), recession is confirmed. Current: **CCI -0.39, GCI -0.4**. Close to synchronized weakness.

---

### Pillar 5 → Pillar 4 (Housing)

Consumer confidence drives **housing demand**:

```
Consumer Confidence ↑ → Home Buying Intentions ↑ →
Housing Demand ↑ → Home Sales ↑ → Home Prices ↑ →
Wealth Effect ↑ → Consumer Spending ↑ (Reinforcing)
```

**Current Linkage:** CB Expectations at 78 (weak), UMich Buying Conditions (homes) at historic lows due to rates/prices. Housing demand frozen. No wealth effect support (prices flat, equity locked).

**Cross-Pillar Signal:** Consumer confidence must recover before housing thaws. When **CCI > +0.3** AND mortgage rates < 6%, housing transactions normalize. Currently: **CCI -0.39**, rates 6.95%. No thaw catalyst.

---

### Pillar 5 → Pillar 9 (Financial)

Consumer credit health affects **bank balance sheets**:

```
Consumer Delinquencies ↑ → Bank Loan Losses ↑ →
Bank Capital Impairment → Credit Tightening →
Consumer Credit Availability ↓ → Spending ↓ (Reinforcing)
```

**Current Linkage:** Credit card delinquency at 3.0% (elevated but not crisis). Bank reserves adequate. No systemic credit crunch yet. But if delinquencies hit 4.5%+, regional bank stress emerges (concentrated consumer lending portfolios).

**Cross-Pillar Signal:** Consumer credit stress (**CCI < -0.5**) combined with bank stress (**credit spreads widening**) creates negative feedback loop. Monitor for simultaneous deterioration.

## Current State Assessment (January 2026)

| **Indicator** | **Current** | **Threshold** | **Assessment** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Real PCE YoY%** | +2.1% | <1.5% = stagnation | 🟡 Decelerating |
| **Personal Saving Rate** | 4.5% | <5.0% = depleted | 🔴 **Below normal** |
| **Credit Card Delinquency** | 3.0% | >3.5% = stressed | 🟡 **Elevated** |
| **CB Expectations** | 78 | <80 = recession signal | 🔴 **Below threshold** |
| **CB Present Situation** | 138 | <120 = weak | 🟢 Still strong |
| **Real DPI YoY%** | +1.2% | <1.5% = squeezed | 🟡 Barely positive |
| **Debt Service Ratio** | 10.8% | >11% = stretched | 🟡 Elevated |
| **Card Spending YoY%** | +2.8% | <2% = weak | 🟡 Slowing |
| **Real Retail Sales YoY%** | +0.2% | <0% = contraction | 🟡 Barely positive |
| **CCI Estimate** | **-0.39** | <-0.5 = stressed | 🟡 **Consumer Fatigued** |

### Narrative Synthesis

The consumer is in **Stage 2 of the stress sequence**: savings depleted, credit stress building, spending maintained but decelerating.

**Stage 1 (Complete):** Excess savings exhausted. $2.1T accumulated during COVID now fully drawn. Saving rate at 4.5% vs 7.5% pre-pandemic normal. No more buffer.

**Stage 2 (Current):** Credit substitution. Credit card balances at record $1.17T. Delinquencies at 3.0% (highest since 2012). APR at 22.8% (record). Consumers borrowing at record rates to maintain spending. Unsustainable.

**Stage 3 (Coming):** Spending cuts. When credit dries up or becomes unaffordable, spending contracts. Durables already contracting (-1.8% YoY). Services next. Real PCE going from +2.1% toward +1.0% or negative.

**The Bifurcation:**
- **Top quintile** (20% of population, 40% of spending): Flush with equity wealth, low debt, spending +4% YoY
- **Bottom three quintiles** (60% of population, 45% of spending): Stressed, trading down, spending flat to negative in real terms
- **Aggregate masks reality:** +2.1% headline is the wealthy carrying the economy

**Cross-Pillar Confirmation:**
- **Labor Pillar:** LFI +0.93 (fragility)—income growth will slow further
- **Prices Pillar:** Consumer weakness is disinflationary—supports "last mile" resolution
- **Housing Pillar:** No wealth effect support (frozen market, prices flat)
- **Growth Pillar:** PCE contributing +1.4 ppts to GDP—if consumer slows, GDP slows

**MRI (Macro Risk Index):** Consumer contributes **-0.3 (CCI)** to composite. Not crisis, but **fragility building**. The consumer is the last domino—it doesn't fall first, but when it falls, it confirms what labor/growth already signaled.

## Invalidation Criteria

### Bull Case (Consumer Resilience) Invalidation Thresholds

If the following occur **simultaneously for 3+ months**, the bearish consumer thesis is invalidated:

✅ **Personal Saving Rate** rises above **6.0%** (buffer rebuilding)
✅ **Credit Card Delinquency** drops below **2.5%** (stress fading)
✅ **Real PCE YoY%** exceeds **3.0%** (acceleration)
✅ **CB Expectations** exceeds **90** (optimism returning)
✅ **Real DPI YoY%** exceeds **2.5%** (income growth supporting spending)
✅ **CCI** exceeds **+0.5** (healthy regime)

**Action if Invalidated:** Rotate to **consumer discretionary** (XLY), **travel/leisure** (PEJ), **retail** (XRT). Consumer strength = cyclical outperformance.

---

### Bear Case (Consumer Collapse) Confirmation Thresholds

If the following occur, consumer is **deteriorating beyond fatigued into crisis**:

🔴 **Real PCE YoY%** turns **negative** (spending contraction)
🔴 **Personal Saving Rate** drops below **3.0%** (desperation)
🔴 **Credit Card Delinquency** exceeds **4.5%** (credit crisis)
🔴 **CB Expectations** drops below **65** (deep pessimism)
🔴 **Retail Sales 3M Avg** turns **negative** (demand destruction)
🔴 **CCI** drops below **-1.0** (crisis regime)

**Action if Confirmed:** Maximum defensive. Overweight **consumer staples** (XLP), **discount retail** (WMT, COST, DG), **utilities** (XLU). Avoid all discretionary exposure.

## Conclusion: The Consumer as the Last Domino

The consumer isn't a leading indicator. It's the **68% of GDP that confirms what everything else already said**.

When quits collapse (6-9 months before), credit stress builds (3-6 months before), and confidence craters (1-3 months before), the consumer **eventually** follows. By the time retail sales go negative, the recession is already underway.

**Current State:**
- **CCI -0.39** (Fatigued Regime)
- **Real PCE +2.1% YoY** (decelerating, not contracting)
- **Saving rate 4.5%** (depleted, no buffer)
- **Credit card delinquency 3.0%** (Stage 2 stress)
- **CB Expectations 78** (below recession threshold)
- **Durables -1.8% YoY** (discretionary already contracting)

**The Sequence:**
1. ✅ **Savings depleted** (Complete—Q3 2025)
2. 🔄 **Credit stress building** (Current—delinquencies rising)
3. ⏳ **Spending cuts coming** (Next—durables leading, services to follow)
4. ⏳ **Recession confirmed** (Final—when PCE goes negative)

**Cross-Pillar Context:** Consumer fatigue (**CCI -0.39**) + labor fragility (**LFI +0.93**) + growth weakness (**GCI -0.4**) = **MRI +1.1** (HIGH RISK regime).

The consumer hasn't cracked. But the cracks are visible. The wealthy are holding up the aggregate. The median consumer is stressed. When the last domino falls, everyone will see what the labor data said 9 months ago.

**That's our view from the Watch. Until next time, we'll be sure to keep the light on....**
