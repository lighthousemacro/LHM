# PILLAR 7: TRADE

## The Trade Transmission Chain

Trade isn't imports and exports. It's the **global margin of adjustment**. The transmission mechanism operates through cascading price and flow dynamics:

```
Dollar Strength → Import Prices → Domestic Inflation →
Export Competitiveness → Manufacturing Output →
Trade Balance → Capital Flows → Dollar Strength (Reinforcing Loop)
```

**The Insight:** Trade is the **pressure release valve** for domestic imbalances. When the U.S. runs a $1T trade deficit, it's exporting demand and importing disinflation. When tariffs disrupt that flow, the adjustment happens somewhere else: prices, margins, or supply chains.

The beauty of trade data: it exposes what domestic data can't. **Relative competitiveness, global demand, and the dollar's purchasing power.** When container volumes collapse before retail sales do, trade data caught it first. When input costs spike before CPI does, import prices told you.

## Why Trade Matters: The Global Transmission Belt

Trade is ~25% of U.S. GDP (exports + imports), but its **impact is 2-3x larger** through:
- **Price transmission:** Import prices flow into PPI, then CPI (3-6 month lag)
- **Manufacturing linkage:** 70% of U.S. manufacturing output is globally integrated
- **Dollar hegemony:** Trade deficit = capital account surplus = Treasury demand
- **Margin pressure:** Input costs determine corporate profitability
- **Capital account mirror:** Every dollar of trade deficit is matched by foreign capital inflow
- **Retail distribution:** The import pipeline feeds directly into domestic retail, wholesale, and e-commerce channels

**The Cascade:**

**1. Trade → Prices:** Import costs drive goods inflation (2-4 month lag)
**2. Trade → Manufacturing:** Export demand determines factory output (coincident)
**3. Trade → Dollar:** Trade flows influence currency valuation (6-12 month lag)
**4. Trade → Corporate Margins:** Input costs squeeze profits (1-2 quarter lag)
**5. Trade → Fed Policy:** Imported inflation complicates monetary stance
**6. Trade → Capital Flows:** Deficit financing determines foreign Treasury demand
**7. Trade → Retail:** Import channels determine inventory, pricing, and domestic distribution

Get the trade call right, and you've triangulated the inflation pipeline, manufacturing outlook, dollar trajectory, and Treasury demand. Miss it, and you're treating the U.S. economy as a closed system, which it hasn't been since 1971.

**The Two-Channel Framework:**

Trade conditions operate through two channels that compound with a lag:

- **Channel 1: The Dollar Channel.** The dollar IS global monetary policy for anyone who borrows in it, invoices in it, or competes against it. Dollar strength = tightening for the world (and eventually for US multinationals). Dollar weakness = easing, but with an inflation pass-through that takes 2-3 quarters to show up in PCE. The DXY is not just a currency metric. It's a financial conditions indicator for the entire global economy.

- **Channel 2: The Tariff/Policy Channel.** Tariffs are a consumption tax with extra steps. The pass-through rate varies by product category, competitive dynamics, and currency offset. Historical tariff pass-through: ~60-70% to consumer prices within 12 months. The 2025-2026 regime shift (SCOTUS IEEPA ruling, Section 122 pivot) structurally changed the policy transmission mechanism.

**The Compounding Effect:**
- Dollar strength + tariff escalation = double tightening on import-dependent sectors
- Dollar weakness + tariff reduction = reflationary impulse that consensus underprices
- The lag structure means today's trade conditions are tomorrow's margin story

**"Flows over stocks" applies here too.** It's not the trade deficit level that matters. It's the rate of change in the dollar, the direction of tariff policy, and the speed of pass-through.

**Levels vs. Direction: A Critical Distinction**

For every trade indicator, we analyze multiple dimensions:
- **Level:** Where is it now? (e.g., trade deficit at -$78B)
- **Direction:** Widening or narrowing? (the turn)
- **Composition:** Import-driven or export-driven? (the quality of the move)
- **Rate of Change:** How fast is it moving?

Critical insight: **Direction changes often lead, even when levels seem stable.** A widening deficit during dollar strength = pull-forward of imports (front-running tariffs). A narrowing deficit during weakness = demand destruction, not competitiveness gains. Context is everything.

**Data Validation Note:** The trade framework is validated against four post-2000 cycles: 2001 (tech bust/dollar peak), 2007-09 (GFC trade collapse), 2018-19 (trade war), and 2020-22 (COVID supply chain crisis). Key validated signals:

| Signal | Validation | Lead Time |
|--------|------------|-----------|
| Import prices >+5% YoY | 3/4 cycles preceded goods inflation acceleration | 3-6 months |
| Broad dollar >+10% YoY | 4/4 cycles preceded export weakness | 3-6 months |
| GSCPI >+2.0 | 2/2 supply chain events preceded manufacturing downturn | 2-4 months |
| Container volumes <-10% YoY | 3/4 cycles preceded retail inventory adjustment | 2-3 months |
| EPUTRADE >200 | 2/2 trade war episodes preceded capex decline | 3-6 months |
| TIC net flows negative for 3+ months | 2/3 cycles preceded Treasury yield spikes | 1-3 months |

Note: The 2020 shock was exogenous (pandemic), not cycle-driven. Some indicators behaved differently.

**The Mosaic Approach:** No single trade indicator captures every cycle. That's why we use multiple indicators serving different purposes:

| Role | Indicators | Purpose |
|------|------------|---------|
| **Leading** | Dollar Z-RoC, import prices, GSCPI, EPUTRADE, TIC flows | Early warning, move first |
| **Volume** | Container throughput, freight indices, bilateral trade | Physical flow confirmation |
| **Price** | Import/export prices, terms of trade | Inflation pipeline |
| **Structural** | Effective tariff rate, China import share, nearshoring metrics | Regime assessment |
| **Financial** | Current account, capital flows, foreign Treasury holdings | Financing sustainability |
| **Domestic Distribution** | Retail trade detail, wholesale inventories, e-commerce | How imports flow through the domestic economy |

## Primary Indicators: The Complete Architecture

### A. TRADE BALANCE (The Flow Signal)

The trade balance measures the net exchange of goods and services. Deficits aren't inherently bad, they reflect demand strength, but persistent deficits funded by debt create fragility. The goods deficit (~$100B/mo) is partially offset by a services surplus (~$22B/mo). The composition matters as much as the level.

| **Indicator** | **FRED Code / Source** | **Frequency** | **Lead/Lag** | **Interpretation** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Trade Balance (Goods & Services)** | BOPGSTB | Monthly | Coincident | Net trade position, headline figure |
| **Trade Balance (Goods Only)** | BOPGTB | Monthly | Coincident | Merchandise trade (larger deficit) |
| **Trade Balance (Services Only)** | BOPSTB | Monthly | Coincident | Services trade (consistent surplus ~$22B) |
| **Exports (Goods & Services, BOP)** | BOPTEXP | Monthly | Coincident | Total U.S. exports, BOP basis |
| **Imports (Goods & Services, BOP)** | BOPTIMP | Monthly | Coincident | Total U.S. imports, BOP basis |
| **Real Exports (Goods & Services)** | EXPGSC1 | Quarterly | Coincident | Volume-based exports (chained 2017$) |
| **Real Imports (Goods & Services)** | IMPGSC1 | Quarterly | Coincident | Volume-based imports (chained 2017$) |
| **Net Exports (GDP Component)** | NETEXP | Quarterly | Lagging | Trade contribution to GDP |
| **Real Net Exports** | NETEXC | Quarterly | Lagging | Real trade contribution to GDP |
| **Nominal Exports (NIPA)** | EXPGS | Quarterly | Coincident | BEA national accounts basis |
| **Nominal Imports (NIPA)** | IMPGS | Quarterly | Coincident | BEA national accounts basis |
| **BEA Exports of G&S (Quarterly)** | IEAXGS | Quarterly | Coincident | BEA international basis |
| **BEA Imports of G&S (Quarterly)** | IEAMGSN | Quarterly | Coincident | BEA international basis (NSA) |
| **Trade Employment** | USTRADE | Monthly | Lagging | All employees, retail trade sector |
| **US Balance of Trade (TV)** | TV_USBOT | Monthly | Coincident | TradingView headline trade balance |
| **US Goods Trade Balance (TV)** | TV_USGTB | Monthly | Coincident | TradingView goods-only balance |
| **US Imports (TV)** | TV_USIMP | Monthly | Coincident | TradingView total imports |
| **US Exports (TV)** | TV_USEXP | Monthly | Coincident | TradingView total exports |
| **US Trade Account (TV)** | TV_USTA | Monthly | Coincident | TradingView trade account |

#### Derived Balance Metrics

| **Metric** | **Formula** | **Threshold** | **Signal** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Trade Balance / GDP** | Balance / GDP x 100 | >-4% | Sustainable deficit range |
| **Export Growth YoY%** | Current - Year Ago | <0% | Export weakness |
| **Import Growth YoY%** | Current - Year Ago | <0% | Demand destruction (or tariff effect) |
| **Goods-Services Split** | Services Surplus / Total Deficit | >25% | Services partially offset goods |
| **Export Concentration** | Top 5 Partners / Total Exports | >50% | Diversification risk |
| **Real Trade Gap Momentum** | 3M MA slope of NETEXC | Negative | Deterioration accelerating |
| **Import-Export Growth Spread** | Import Growth - Export Growth | >+5 ppts | Deficit expansion accelerating |

#### Regime Thresholds: Trade Balance

| **Indicator** | **Crisis** | **Stressed** | **Normal** | **Strong** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Trade Balance (Monthly, $B)** | >-$100B | -$100B to -$70B | -$70B to -$50B | >-$50B |
| **Export Growth YoY%** | <-5% | -5% to 0% | 0% to +5% | >+5% |
| **Import Growth YoY%** | <-5% or >+10% | -5% to +0% | 0% to +5% | +5% to +10% |
| **Trade Balance / GDP** | >-5% | -5% to -3.5% | -3.5% to -2.5% | <-2.5% |

**Historical Validation:**

| **Cycle** | **Trade Balance Behavior** | **Lead Time** | **Outcome** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **2001** | Deficit narrowed 6M before recession (import demand collapsed) | 6 months | -16% export decline |
| **2007-09** | Deficit widened to -$67B (Jul 2008), then collapsed to -$26B (Feb 2009) | Coincident | Trade contributed to GDP collapse Q4 2008 |
| **2018-19** | Trade war front-loading: deficit widened to -$68B as importers rushed ahead of tariffs | 3-6 months | ISM manufacturing <50 by Sep 2019 |
| **2020-22** | Deficit exploded to -$100B+ as supply chains broke and imports surged | Exogenous | Supply chain crisis, goods inflation |

**The Deficit Paradox:** Trade deficit at **-$78B** (Nov 2025), narrowing from -$95B peak (March 2025). But the narrowing is **demand destruction, not competitiveness**. Imports falling faster than exports. Tariffs suppressing inbound goods. This is the wrong kind of improvement. It signals domestic weakness, not manufacturing renaissance.

### B. IMPORT/EXPORT PRICES (The Inflation Pipeline)

Import and export prices are the **leading edge of inflation transmission**. Import prices today are CPI goods inflation in 3-6 months. This is the pipeline where tariffs, dollar moves, and commodity prices convert into domestic purchasing power changes. The BLS releases these monthly, ~14 days after month-end, making them among the earliest inflation signals available.

| **Indicator** | **FRED Code** | **Frequency** | **Lead/Lag** | **Interpretation** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Import Price Index (All)** | IR | Monthly | **Leads CPI goods 3-6 mo** | Total import prices |
| **Import Prices ex-Petroleum** | IREXPET | Monthly | Leads core goods 3-4 mo | Core import prices (strips oil noise) |
| **Import Prices: Industrial Supplies** | IR1 | Monthly | Leads PPI 2-3 mo | Commodity input costs |
| **Import Prices: Consumer Goods** | IR4 | Monthly | **Leads retail prices 2-4 mo** | Final goods prices |
| **Import Prices: Capital Goods** | IR2 | Monthly | Coincident | Equipment/machinery costs |
| **Export Price Index** | IQ | Monthly | Coincident | U.S. competitiveness proxy |
| **Export Prices: Agricultural** | IQAG | Monthly | Coincident | Farm export prices (weather, demand) |
| **Export Prices: Nonagricultural** | IQEXAG | Monthly | Coincident | Manufactured export prices |
| **Imports from China** | IMPCH | Monthly | Coincident | China-specific import prices/volumes |
| **Exports to China** | EXPCH | Monthly | Coincident | China-specific export demand |
| **Imports from Japan** | IMPJP | Monthly | Coincident | Japan supply chain (autos, semiconductors) |
| **Exports to Japan** | EXPJP | Monthly | Coincident | Japan trade relationship |

#### Derived Price Metrics

| **Metric** | **Formula** | **Threshold** | **Signal** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Import Price YoY%** | Current - Year Ago | >+5% | Imported inflation pressure |
| **Import ex-Petro YoY%** | Current - Year Ago | >+3% | Core import inflation |
| **Terms of Trade Change** | Export Price YoY - Import Price YoY | <-2 ppts | Competitiveness deteriorating |
| **Tariff Pass-Through** | Import Price Change / Tariff Rate Change | >0.6 | High pass-through to consumers |
| **Import-CPI Goods Spread** | Import Price YoY - CPI Goods YoY | >+3 ppts | Pipeline pressure building |
| **Import-PPI Pipeline** | Import Price ex-Petro 3M Δ - PPI Final Demand 3M Δ | >+1 ppt | Pressure not yet absorbed |
| **China vs All Import Spread** | China Import YoY - Total Import YoY | Divergence | Tariff-specific vs broad trade impact |

#### Regime Thresholds: Trade Prices

| **Indicator** | **Deflationary** | **Stable** | **Inflationary** | **Crisis** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Import Price YoY%** | <-3% | -3% to +3% | **+3% to +8%** | >+8% |
| **Import ex-Petro YoY%** | <-2% | -2% to +2% | **+2% to +5%** | >+5% |
| **Export Price YoY%** | <-3% | -3% to +3% | +3% to +6% | >+6% |
| **Terms of Trade YoY%** | <-3% | -3% to +3% | +3% to +6% | >+6% |

**Historical Validation: The 3-6 Month Import Price-to-CPI Lag**

| **Episode** | **Import Price Move** | **CPI Goods Response** | **Lag** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **2007-08** | Import prices +20% YoY (Jul 2008) | CPI goods +8% YoY (Oct 2008) | ~3 months |
| **2014-16** | Import prices -11% YoY (Jan 2015) | CPI goods -2.3% YoY (Aug 2015) | ~7 months |
| **2018-19** | Import prices +4.5% (Sep 2018, tariffs) | CPI goods +0.8% (Mar 2019) | ~6 months |
| **2021-22** | Import prices +13% YoY (Mar 2022) | CPI goods +14% YoY (Jun 2022) | ~3 months |
| **2025** | Import prices +3.8% YoY (Dec 2025) | CPI goods response pending Q1-Q2 2026 | Estimated 3-4 months |

The pass-through varies by composition. Oil-driven spikes hit faster (~2 months). Tariff-driven increases are slower (~4-6 months) because retailers absorb margins initially. Dollar-driven moves are the slowest (~6 months) because contractual lags in pricing.

**The Tariff Transmission:** Import prices at **+3.8% YoY** (Dec 2025), highest since 2022. Ex-petroleum at **+2.9%**. This isn't oil. This is **tariff pass-through**. The 25% tariffs on Chinese goods are flowing into consumer prices with a 3-6 month lag. We're seeing the inflationary impact of trade policy in real time.

---

### C. DOLLAR DYNAMICS (The Relative Price of Everything)

The dollar is the **meta-variable** of trade. Strong dollar = cheap imports, expensive exports. Weak dollar = inflation imported, exports competitive. The Fed's trade-weighted dollar indices are superior to the DXY for trade analysis because they weight by actual trade flows rather than arbitrary currency baskets. The BIS real effective exchange rate adjusts for inflation differentials, making it the gold standard for competitiveness analysis.

**Why Broad > DXY:** The DXY is 57% EUR, which massively overweights Europe and underweights China, Mexico, and Canada, the partners that actually matter for U.S. trade. The Fed's broad index (DTWEXBGS) weights by actual trade flows. The BIS REER adjusts for inflation differentials. For trade analysis, always use trade-weighted measures.

| **Indicator** | **FRED Code** | **Frequency** | **Lead/Lag** | **Interpretation** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Broad Dollar Index (Goods & Services)** | DTWEXBGS | Daily | **Leads trade prices 3-6 mo** | USD vs all trading partners (Fed index) |
| **Advanced Foreign Economies Dollar Index** | DTWEXAFEGS | Daily | Leads DM trade 3-6 mo | USD vs developed markets (EU, Japan, UK, etc.) |
| **Emerging Market Economies Dollar Index** | DTWEXEMEGS | Daily | Leads EM trade 3-6 mo | USD vs EM currencies (China, Mexico, Korea, etc.) |

#### Derived Dollar Metrics

| **Metric** | **Formula** | **Threshold** | **Signal** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Broad Dollar YoY%** | DTWEXBGS Current - Year Ago | >+10% | Dollar strength crushing trade |
| **Real TWI YoY%** | RTWEXBGS Current - Year Ago | >+8% | Competitiveness deteriorating |
| **DM-EM Dollar Spread** | DTWEXAFEGS YoY - DTWEXEMEGS YoY | >+5 ppts | EM under disproportionate stress |
| **Dollar-Rate Spread** | Broad Dollar YoY - Fed Funds Change | >+5 ppts | Dollar strength beyond rate differential |
| **Yuan Deviation** | USD/CNY vs 50d MA | >3% | Currency tensions escalating |
| **BIS REER Deviation from Mean** | RBUSBIS vs 10Y avg | >+10% | Dollar overvalued on competitiveness basis |
| **Dollar Z-RoC (63d)** | z-score of 63-day rate of change | >+1.5 or <-1.5 | Extreme momentum (reversal probable) |
| **MXN-CNY Convergence** | MXN and CNY both weakening vs USD | Both >+3% YoY | Nearshoring AND China both under pressure |

#### Regime Thresholds: Dollar

| **Indicator** | **USD Weak** | **USD Neutral** | **USD Strong** | **USD Crisis** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Broad Dollar Level (Index)** | <105 | 105-120 | **120-135** | >135 |
| **Broad Dollar YoY%** | <-5% | -5% to +5% | **+5% to +12%** | >+12% |
| **Real TWI YoY%** | <-3% | -3% to +5% | **+5% to +10%** | >+10% |
| **USD/CNY** | <7.0 | 7.0-7.3 | **7.3-7.5** | >7.5 |
| **BIS REER vs 10Y Avg** | <-5% | -5% to +5% | **+5% to +10%** | >+10% |
| **Dollar Z-RoC (63d)** | <-1.5 | -1.5 to +1.5 | **>+1.5** | Sustained >+2.0 |

**Historical Validation: Dollar Strength and Trade Outcomes**

| **Dollar Episode** | **Broad Dollar Move** | **Export Impact** | **Lag** | **Secondary Effects** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **1997-2002 Rally** | +25% | Exports -7% (2001) | 12-18 months | EM crisis, manufacturing recession |
| **2014-2016 Rally** | +18% | Exports -5% (2016) | 6-12 months | Oil collapse compounded |
| **2018 Rally** | +8% | Exports -2% (2019) | 6 months | Trade war amplified |
| **2022 Rally** | +12% | Exports flat (hedged by supply chain rebuild) | Delayed | Dollar strength offset by supply normalization |
| **2024-2025** | +7.2% YoY | Exports -2.1% (Dec 2025) | In progress | Tariff regime compounding |

Sustained dollar strength of >10% YoY has preceded every EM crisis and most US earnings recessions in the past 30 years.

**The Strong Dollar Trap:** Broad dollar index at **108.5** (Jan 2026), near 20-year highs. Real trade-weighted at **+7.8% YoY**. This **crushes export competitiveness** and **pressures EM debtors** (dollar-denominated debt). But it also **imports disinflation**: strong dollar = cheap imports. The Fed's rate differential vs ECB/BoJ keeps the dollar elevated. The BIS REER confirms: the dollar is ~12% above its 10-year average in real terms. This is unsustainable long-term but can persist for years when driven by rate differentials.

**Connection to CLI (Crypto Liquidity Impulse):** Dollar weakening is one of the strongest single-factor relationships for crypto. When the dollar Z-RoC goes negative AND global M2 accelerates, BTC has historically returned +34% next quarter (84.7% hit rate). The dollar channel is crypto's macro backbone.

### D. BILATERAL TRADE (The Geopolitical Signal)

Not all trade partners are equal. The U.S.-China relationship, nearshoring to Mexico, and European dynamics tell different stories. Bilateral data exposes the real-world impact of tariffs, supply chain rerouting, and geopolitical alignment. FRED provides monthly bilateral goods data for China and Japan. Census Bureau provides comprehensive bilateral data for all partners via their International Trade API.

| **Indicator** | **FRED Code** | **Frequency** | **Lead/Lag** | **Interpretation** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **U.S. Exports to China** | EXPCH | Monthly | Coincident | China export demand (retaliatory target) |
| **U.S. Imports from China** | IMPCH | Monthly | Coincident | China import dependence (tariff impact) |
| **U.S. Exports to Japan** | EXPJP | Monthly | Coincident | Japan trade relationship |
| **U.S. Imports from Japan** | IMPJP | Monthly | Coincident | Japan supply chain (autos, semiconductors) |
| **China Bilateral Balance** | Derived: IMPCH - EXPCH | Monthly | Coincident | U.S.-China trade gap |
| **Census Bilateral (All Partners)** | Census API | Monthly | Coincident | Full bilateral matrix |

#### Bilateral Trade Matrix (Current)

| **Bilateral** | **Trade Balance** | **YoY Change** | **Trend** | **Signal** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **China** | -$24.5B/mo (Nov 2025) | -18% | Narrowing | Tariff impact + decoupling |
| **Mexico** | -$12.8B/mo | +8% | Widening | Nearshoring beneficiary |
| **Canada** | -$6.2B/mo | +2% | Stable | USMCA normalization |
| **EU** | -$18.4B/mo | +5% | Widening | Dollar strength + demand |
| **Vietnam** | -$9.1B/mo | +32% | Widening rapidly | China-substitute |
| **Japan** | -$6.8B/mo | -5% | Narrowing | Yen weakness offsetting |

#### Derived Bilateral Metrics

| **Metric** | **Formula** | **Threshold** | **Signal** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **China Share of Deficit** | China Deficit / Total Deficit | <20% | Decoupling accelerating |
| **China Import Share** | China Imports / Total Imports | <14% | Structural diversification |
| **Mexico + Vietnam Share** | Combined / Total Imports | >18% | Nearshoring success |
| **Ally vs Adversary Trade Ratio** | (EU+Japan+UK) / (China+Russia) | >3.0 | Friendshoring strengthening |
| **USMCA Concentration** | (Mexico+Canada) / Total Trade | >35% | North American integration |
| **China-Vietnam Substitution Rate** | Vietnam Import Growth / China Import Decline | >0.5 | Trade rerouting (potential circumvention) |

#### Regime Thresholds: Bilateral

| **Indicator** | **Decoupled** | **Diversifying** | **Dependent** | **Concentrated** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **China Import Share** | <10% | **10-14%** | 14-18% | >18% |
| **Top 5 Partner Concentration** | <40% | 40-50% | 50-60% | >60% |
| **USMCA Share of Total Trade** | <25% | 25-35% | **35-45%** | >45% |
| **Vietnam YoY Import Growth** | <5% | 5-15% | **15-30%** | >30% |

**The Decoupling Reality:** China's share of U.S. goods imports has fallen from **21.6%** (2017) to **12.8%** (Dec 2025). But the deficit hasn't disappeared. It's **shifted to Mexico (+$8.4B YoY), Vietnam (+$6.2B YoY), and India (+$2.1B YoY)**. We're not reducing dependence on imports. We're diversifying supply chains. That's resilience, not autarky. The China-Vietnam substitution rate is running at 0.7, meaning for every dollar of Chinese imports we lose, $0.70 shows up from Vietnam. The goods still arrive. The routing just changed.

### E. CURRENT ACCOUNT & CAPITAL FLOWS (The Financial Mirror)

Every trade deficit has a capital account surplus mirror. When the U.S. imports more than it exports, foreigners accumulate dollar assets. This is the **financial plumbing of trade**: Treasury International Capital (TIC) flows show who is buying U.S. assets, BEA current account data shows the comprehensive external position (trade + income + transfers), and capital flow data reveals whether foreigners are financing the deficit willingly or reluctantly.

| **Indicator** | **FRED Code / Source** | **Frequency** | **Lead/Lag** | **Interpretation** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Current Account Balance** | IEABC | Quarterly | Lagging | Comprehensive external balance (trade + income + transfers) |
| **Current Account: Goods** | IEABCG | Quarterly | Lagging | Goods component (mirrors BOPGTB, quarterly) |
| **Current Account: Services** | IEABCS | Quarterly | Lagging | Services surplus (tech, finance, IP) |
| **Current Account: Primary Income** | IEABCPI | Quarterly | Lagging | Investment income (dividends, interest on foreign assets) |
| **Current Account: Secondary Income** | IEABCSI | Quarterly | Lagging | Transfers (remittances, foreign aid) |
| **Balance on Capital Account** | IEABCP | Quarterly | Lagging | Capital transfers (smaller, typically near zero) |
| **Balance on Capital Account NSA** | IEABCPN | Quarterly | Lagging | Capital account not seasonally adjusted |
| **TIC Net Long-Term Flows** | TV_USTICNLF | Monthly | **Leads Treasury demand 1-3 mo** | Foreign buying of U.S. long-term securities |

| **Episode** | **TIC Flow Pattern** | **Treasury Yield Impact** | **Lag** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **2013-14** | China/Japan reduced holdings steadily | 10Y rose ~100bps (taper tantrum compounded) | 1-3 months |
| **2018** | Foreign official flows turned negative | 10Y hit 3.2% (Oct 2018) | Coincident |
| **2022** | Japan sold ~$200B Treasuries (yen defense) | 10Y spiked from 1.5% to 4.3% | Coincident |
| **2025** | Japan and China slowly reducing, European/ME offsetting | Yields elevated but stable (~4.4%) | Ongoing |

**The Financing Question:** The U.S. current account deficit is ~**-3.5% of GDP** (Q3 2025). Historically sustainable, but the composition matters. **Primary income remains positive** (~$60B/quarter), meaning the U.S. earns more on its foreign investments than foreigners earn on their U.S. holdings. This is the "dark matter" of international finance: U.S. assets are higher-returning despite the deficit. The risk is when TIC flows turn negative, meaning foreigners are **selling** U.S. assets rather than buying. Watch Japan and China's Treasury holdings: both have been slowly reducing, offset by European and Middle Eastern buying.

The capital flow section connects directly to the **Plumbing Pillar (P10)** and the **Government Pillar (P8)**. Trade deficit narrowing = less automatic Treasury demand from trade partners. This is the fiscal dominance transmission: when trade no longer finances the deficit automatically, the term premium must rise to attract marginal buyers.

### F. SUPPLY CHAIN INDICATORS (The Flow Disruption Signal)

Supply chains are the **circulatory system** of global trade. When they clog, prices spike and production stalls. The NY Fed's Global Supply Chain Pressure Index (GSCPI) synthesizes 27 variables across shipping costs, delivery times, and backlogs into a single z-score. Port of LA/Long Beach container data provides real-time U.S. import volume signals. Freight indices (Baltic Dry, Harpex) lead import prices by 2-3 months.

| **Indicator** | **Source** | **Frequency** | **Lead/Lag** | **Interpretation** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **NY Fed GSCPI** | NY Fed (Excel) | Monthly | **Leads IP 2-4 mo** | Global Supply Chain Pressure Index (z-score) |
| **Container Throughput (LA/LB Ports)** | Port of LA (Socrata API) | Monthly | **Leads retail 2-3 mo** | U.S. import volume proxy (~40% of containers) |
| **Baltic Dry Index** | Baltic Exchange | Daily | **Leads global trade 2-4 mo** | Bulk shipping demand (raw materials) |
| **Harpex Container Index** | Harper Petersen | Weekly | Leads container rates 1-2 mo | Container shipping rates |
| **ISM Supplier Delivery Times** | ISM (TV_USBCOI subs) | Monthly | Leads IP 1-2 mo | Manufacturing bottlenecks (>50 = slowing) |
| **ISM Backlogs of Orders** | ISM | Monthly | Leads production 1-2 mo | Order pipeline pressure |
| **Rail Intermodal Volume** | RAILFRTINTERMODALD11 | Monthly | Coincident | Container-on-rail (domestic distribution) |

| **Transportation Services Index** | TSIFRGHT | Monthly | Coincident | BTS freight index |
| **Truck Tonnage Index** | TRUCKD11 | Monthly | Coincident | ATA truck tonnage (domestic goods movement) |

#### Derived Supply Chain Metrics

| **Metric** | **Formula** | **Threshold** | **Signal** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **GSCPI Level** | NY Fed Index (z-score) | >+1.5 | Supply stress |
| **GSCPI Momentum** | Current - 3M Avg | >+0.5 | Deterioration accelerating |
| **Container Volume YoY%** | LA/LB TEU Current - Year Ago | <-5% | Trade contraction |
| **Delivery Time Gap** | ISM Deliveries - 50 (neutral) | >+5 | Bottlenecks building |
| **Freight-GDP Divergence** | Freight Vol YoY - GDP YoY | <-3 ppts | Goods recession |

#### Regime Thresholds: Supply Chains

| **Indicator** | **Loose** | **Normal** | **Tight** | **Crisis** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **NY Fed GSCPI** | <-1.0 | -1.0 to +1.0 | **+1.0 to +2.5** | >+2.5 |
| **ISM Supplier Deliveries** | <48 | 48-55 | **55-65** | >65 |

| **Truck Tonnage YoY%** | >+5% | -2% to +5% | **-5% to -2%** | <-5% |

**Historical Validation: Supply Chain Stress and Real Economy**

| **Episode** | **GSCPI Peak** | **IP Impact** | **Lag** | **Duration** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **2011 (Japan earthquake)** | +2.1 | IP -1.5% (3 months later) | 2-3 months | 6 months |
| **2021-22 (COVID supply chains)** | +4.3 (Dec 2021) | IP growth slowed but positive | 3-4 months | 18 months |
| **2024 (Red Sea disruption)** | +1.2 | Minimal IP impact (rerouting) | N/A | 4 months |
| **2025 (tariff front-loading)** | +0.8 | IP -0.8% YoY (compounded by tariffs) | Ongoing | Ongoing |

**The Supply Chain Reset:** NY Fed GSCPI at **+0.8** (Dec 2025), elevated but not crisis. Supplier deliveries at **52.4** (normalizing). Container rates at **$3,850/FEU** (up from $1,500 lows but below $20k peak). The **supply chain crisis is over**. But tariff-induced rerouting (Vietnam, Mexico, India instead of China) creates **new inefficiencies**. We're trading capacity constraints for logistics complexity. Longer routes, more transshipment hubs, more points of failure.

### G. TARIFFS & TRADE POLICY (The 2026 Regime Shift)

Tariffs are no longer cyclical noise. They're **structural reshaping** of global trade. The 2025-2026 tariff escalation changed the game. The Trade Policy Uncertainty Index (EPUTRADE on FRED) captures newspaper coverage of trade policy uncertainty and leads capex decisions by 3-6 months. The effective tariff rate (tariff revenue / import value) provides a single number for the aggregate tariff burden.

**The 2025-2026 Legal Regime Shift:**

The Supreme Court struck down IEEPA-based tariff authority (6-3 ruling, 2025). The administration pivoted to Section 122 of the Trade Act, which caps effective rates at 15% and requires a 150-day sunset. Section 122 tariffs expire **July 24, 2026**. This is a live structural shift:

- **Pre-SCOTUS:** IEEPA gave broad executive tariff authority. Rates could go to 60%+ on targeted countries.
- **Post-SCOTUS:** Section 122 caps at 15%, expires automatically, requires balance-of-payments justification.
- **The Gap:** Between SCOTUS ruling and Section 122 implementation, effective rates temporarily dropped. Front-loading behavior reversed.
- **What's Next:** Three paths: lapse (rates revert to ~1.5% baseline), Congressional legislation (permanent but uncertain rate), or new executive authority (maximum uncertainty).

| **Indicator** | **Source** | **Frequency** | **Lead/Lag** | **Interpretation** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Trade Policy Uncertainty Index** | FRED (EPUTRADE) | Monthly | **Leads capex 3-6 mo** | Newspaper-based uncertainty gauge |
| **Average Tariff Rate (Imports)** | USITC | Annual + Ad Hoc | Structural | Weighted-average tariff on all imports |
| **Tariff Revenue** | Treasury Monthly Statement | Monthly | Coincident | Customs duties collected |
| **China Section 301 Tariff Rate** | USTR | Structural | Lagging | China-specific tariff rate |
| **Retaliatory Tariff Tracker** | WTO | Ad hoc | Lagging | Foreign tariffs on U.S. exports |
| **Iacoviello TPU Index** | Fed Board | Monthly | Leads capex 3-6 mo | Fed staff trade uncertainty measure |
| **World Trade Uncertainty Index** | WorldUncertaintyIndex.com | Quarterly | Structural | Global trade uncertainty (143 countries) |

#### Derived Tariff Metrics

| **Metric** | **Formula** | **Threshold** | **Signal** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Effective Tariff Rate** | Tariff Revenue / Import Value | >4% | Elevated protection |
| **China Import Share** | China Imports / Total Imports | <14% | Decoupling accelerating |
| **Tariff-Inflation Correlation** | Tariff YoY vs CPI Goods YoY (6M lag) | >+0.5 | High pass-through |
| **Trade Policy Uncertainty** | EPUTRADE Index Level | >200 | Elevated uncertainty |
| **Tariff Escalation Rate** | Avg Tariff Current - Avg Tariff 1Y Ago | >+2 ppts | Active escalation |
| **Section 122 Days Remaining** | Expiry date - Today | <90 days | Policy cliff approaching |

#### Regime Thresholds: Tariffs

| **Indicator** | **Free Trade** | **Moderate** | **Protectionist** | **Trade War** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Average Tariff Rate** | <2.5% | 2.5-4.0% | **4.0-8.0%** | >8.0% |
| **China Import Share** | >18% | 14-18% | **10-14%** | <10% |
| **Trade Policy Uncertainty (EPUTRADE)** | <100 | 100-150 | **150-250** | >250 |
| **Tariff Revenue (Monthly, $B)** | <$5B | $5-8B | **$8-12B** | >$12B |
| **Effective Tariff Rate** | <2% | 2-4% | **4-6%** | >6% |

#### Tariff Pass-Through Mechanics

Not all tariffs hit consumers equally. The pass-through depends on:

| **Factor** | **High Pass-Through (>70%)** | **Low Pass-Through (<40%)** |
|---|---|---|
| **Product type** | Consumer goods (clothing, toys, electronics) | Intermediate goods (components, raw materials) |
| **Market structure** | Few substitutes, inelastic demand | Many substitutes, elastic demand |
| **Currency offset** | Source country currency stable | Source country depreciates (absorbs tariff) |
| **Margin buffer** | Thin retailer margins (grocery, dollar stores) | Fat distributor margins (luxury, tech) |
| **Supply chain length** | Short (direct import to retail) | Long (multiple intermediaries absorb) |

Historical research (Fajgelbaum et al., 2020; Amiti et al., 2019) finds ~60-70% aggregate pass-through to U.S. consumer prices within 12 months, with near-100% pass-through for consumer goods from China.

#### Section 122 Scenario Framework

| **Scenario** | **Effective Rate** | **TCI Impact** | **Inflation Impact** | **Key Watch** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Lapse (no renewal)** | ~1.5% baseline | Reflationary, TCI improves +0.3-0.5 | Goods deflation resumes | Import surge post-expiry |
| **Congressional legislation** | Varies (3-10%) | Depends on rate; policy certainty premium | Moderate, predictable | Bipartisan support level |
| **New executive authority** | Unknown (potentially higher) | Maximum uncertainty, TCI volatile | Tail risk: stagflationary | Legal challenge timeline |

**The Tariff Regime:** Average effective tariff rate at **6.2%** (Dec 2025), highest since 1930s Smoot-Hawley. China import share has fallen from 22% (2017) to **12.8%** (Dec 2025): decoupling is real. EPUTRADE at **187**, elevated but below 2019 peaks. We're not in a trade war. We're in a **new normal** of managed trade. The Section 122 expiry on July 24, 2026 is the most important trade policy date on the calendar.

**Data Note:** Clean, real-time effective tariff rate data is not freely available as a time series. The USITC DataWeb provides granular tariff schedules but not a single weighted-average. For our framework, we derive the effective rate from Treasury customs revenue (Monthly Treasury Statement) divided by total import value (BOPTIMP). This is approximate but directionally reliable.

### H. ENERGY TRADE (The Commodity Channel)

The U.S. energy trade position has structurally shifted from net importer to near-net exporter over the past decade. This matters for trade because: (1) oil import volumes are a major driver of the goods trade deficit, (2) energy exports have become a significant contributor to the capital account, and (3) oil production is a real-time indicator of domestic economic activity and global demand.

| **Indicator** | **Source** | **Frequency** | **Lead/Lag** | **Interpretation** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **US Crude Oil Production** | TV_USCOP | Monthly | Coincident | Domestic production (EIA basis) |
| **US Weekly Crude Oil Production** | TV_USWCOP | Weekly | **Leading (high-frequency)** | EIA weekly estimate |
| **US Oil Exports** | TV_USOE | Monthly | Coincident | Crude + product exports |
| **WTI Crude Oil** | DCOILWTICO | Daily | Coincident | Domestic benchmark price |
| **Import Price Index: All** | IR | Monthly | Leads CPI 3-6 mo | Includes petroleum component |
| **Import Prices: Industrial Supplies** | IR1 | Monthly | Leads PPI 2-3 mo | Commodity input channel |

#### Derived Energy Trade Metrics

| **Metric** | **Formula** | **Threshold** | **Signal** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Oil Export Growth YoY%** | TV_USOE Current vs Year Ago | <-5% | Global demand weakening |
| **Production-Export Ratio** | TV_USCOP / TV_USOE | <2.0 | Export-heavy (global demand pulling) |
| **Weekly vs Monthly Production Gap** | TV_USWCOP - TV_USCOP trend | Divergence | Real-time production shift |
| **Energy Trade Balance** | Energy Exports - Energy Imports | >$0 | Net energy exporter (structural shift) |
| **Oil Import Share of Trade Deficit** | Petroleum imports / Total goods deficit | <20% | Declining structural driver |

**The Structural Shift:** The U.S. went from importing ~10M barrels/day net in 2005 to near-net-zero by 2020 and fluctuating around balance since. This means the trade deficit is increasingly a manufactured goods and consumer goods story, not an energy story. When import prices spike, check whether it's oil or tariffs. In 2025, it's tariffs.

### I. DOMESTIC DISTRIBUTION (The Retail Trade Channel)

Trade doesn't end at the port. Imports flow through wholesale distributors, retail chains, and e-commerce platforms before reaching the consumer. Tracking the domestic distribution channel reveals how import price pressures translate into retail pricing, which categories absorb margins vs pass through costs, and where inventory buildups signal demand softness.

| **Indicator** | **FRED Code** | **Frequency** | **Lead/Lag** | **Interpretation** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Retail Sales (Total)** | RSAFS | Monthly | Coincident | Total retail activity |
| **Real Retail Sales** | RRSFS | Monthly | Coincident | Inflation-adjusted retail (real purchasing power) |

| **Food Services & Drinking** | RSFSDP | Monthly | Coincident | Services spending proxy |
| **Nonstore Retailers** | RSNSR | Monthly | Coincident | E-commerce + catalog + mail order |

#### Derived Domestic Distribution Metrics

| **Metric** | **Formula** | **Threshold** | **Signal** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Real vs Nominal Retail Spread** | Nominal Retail YoY - Real Retail YoY | >+3 ppts | Inflation eroding real spending |
| **Import-Sensitive Category Growth** | Avg(Electronics, Clothing, Furniture) YoY | <-3% | Tariff demand destruction |
| **E-Commerce Penetration Rate** | ECOMPCTSA level | >18% | Structural channel shift |
| **Grocery vs Restaurant Spread** | Grocery YoY - Restaurant YoY | >+3 ppts | Consumer trading down |
| **Building Materials Momentum** | RSBMGESD 3M MA slope | Negative | Construction deceleration |

#### Regime Thresholds: Domestic Distribution

| **Indicator** | **Contraction** | **Soft** | **Normal** | **Strong** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Real Retail Sales YoY%** | <-2% | -2% to +1% | **+1% to +4%** | >+4% |
| **Import-Sensitive Category YoY%** | <-5% | -5% to 0% | **0% to +5%** | >+5% |
| **E-Commerce Growth YoY%** | <+5% | +5% to +10% | **+10% to +15%** | >+15% |
| **Nominal-Real Retail Spread** | >+4 ppts | +2 to +4 ppts | **0 to +2 ppts** | <0 ppts |

**The Category Signal:** Import-sensitive retail categories (electronics, clothing, furniture) are the canary for tariff pass-through. When these categories show declining volumes with stable or rising prices, tariffs are biting. When they show declining volumes AND prices, demand destruction is overwhelming tariff effects. Current pattern: volumes declining, prices rising in clothing and electronics = tariff pass-through dominant.

**Connection to Consumer Pillar (P5):** Real retail sales feed directly into CCI. When import price inflation (Pillar 7) erodes real retail spending (Pillar 5), the transmission chain is: tariffs → import prices → retail prices → real spending power → consumer conditions. This is the path from trade policy to consumer pain.

### J. INVENTORIES & WHOLESALE (The Absorption Signal)

Inventories sit at the intersection of trade and domestic demand. When imports surge ahead of demand, inventories build. When supply chains break, inventories deplete. The inventory-to-sales ratio is the barometer: rising I/S signals either weakening demand or over-ordering, falling I/S signals either strong demand or supply constraints. Wholesale inventories are particularly trade-sensitive because wholesalers are the first domestic link in the import chain.

| **Indicator** | **FRED Code** | **Frequency** | **Lead/Lag** | **Interpretation** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Total Business I/S Ratio** | ISRATIO | Monthly | **Leads GDP 1-2 qtrs** | Broadest inventory signal |
| **Retail I/S Ratio** | RETAILIRSA | Monthly | Leads retail sales 1-2 mo | Retail stock levels |
| **Wholesale I/S Ratio** | WHLSLRIRSA | Monthly | Leads wholesale orders 1-2 mo | Wholesale absorption (trade-sensitive) |
| **Manufacturers I/S Ratio** | MNFCTRIRSA | Monthly | Coincident | Factory stock levels |
| **Retail Inventories** | RETAILIMSA | Monthly | Coincident | Nominal inventory levels |
| **Total Business Inventories** | BUSINV | Monthly | Coincident | Nominal business inventories |
| **Real Manufacturing & Trade Sales** | CMRMTSPL | Monthly | Coincident | Real sales (denominator for I/S) |
| **Real Manufacturing & Trade Inventories** | INVCMRMTSPL | Monthly | Coincident | Real inventory levels (numerator for I/S) |
| **Wholesale Nondurable: Beer Wine Spirits** | S4248SM144NCEN | Monthly | Coincident | Wholesale distribution proxy |

#### Derived Inventory Metrics

| **Metric** | **Formula** | **Threshold** | **Signal** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Total I/S vs 5Y Average** | ISRATIO - 5Y Mean | >+0.05 | Inventory bloat |
| **Wholesale I/S Trend** | 3M MA Slope | >0 | Wholesale absorption weakening |
| **Retail I/S vs Pre-COVID** | RETAILIRSA - Feb 2020 level | >+0.10 | Overstock vs normalized demand |
| **Manufacturer I/S Momentum** | Current - 6M Avg | >+0.03 | Factory destocking signal |
| **Import-Inventory Divergence** | Import Growth YoY - Inventory Growth YoY | >+5 ppts | Imports outpacing absorption |
| **Real I/S Ratio** | INVCMRMTSPL / CMRMTSPL | Level vs trend | Volume-adjusted absorption |

#### Regime Thresholds: Inventories

| **Indicator** | **Lean** | **Normal** | **Heavy** | **Bloated** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Total Business I/S Ratio** | <1.25 | 1.25-1.40 | **1.40-1.50** | >1.50 |
| **Retail I/S Ratio** | <1.20 | 1.20-1.40 | **1.40-1.55** | >1.55 |
| **Wholesale I/S Ratio** | <1.20 | 1.20-1.35 | **1.35-1.45** | >1.45 |
| **Manufacturers I/S Ratio** | <1.30 | 1.30-1.45 | **1.45-1.55** | >1.55 |

**Historical Validation: Inventory Cycles and Trade**

| **Cycle** | **Inventory Behavior** | **Trade Link** | **Outcome** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **2007-08** | I/S ratio spiked from 1.28 to 1.46 as demand collapsed | Imports fell 28% peak-to-trough | 3 quarters of inventory liquidation |
| **2015-16** | Wholesale I/S elevated (energy sector overstocking) | Dollar strength suppressed exports | "Manufacturing recession" without GDP recession |
| **2018-19** | Front-loading: inventories surged as importers rushed ahead of tariffs | Import surge then sharp reversal | GDP volatility (Q1-Q2 2019 trade-driven swings) |
| **2021-22** | Post-COVID over-ordering drove I/S to 1.35+ | Container imports at record levels | Bullwhip effect: destocking through 2023 |

**The Inventory Cycle:** Total business I/S at **1.37** (Nov 2025), in normal range. Wholesale I/S at **1.33**, also normal. But the composition tells a story: **import-sensitive wholesale inventories** are rising while **retail inventories** remain tight. This suggests a front-loading effect, importers stocking ahead of tariff escalation, that will reverse in Q1-Q2 2026. When it does, import volumes will drop sharply, temporarily narrowing the trade deficit for the wrong reason.

### K. TERMS OF TRADE & COMPETITIVENESS (The Margin Signal)

Terms of trade measure what the U.S. gets for what it sells relative to what it pays for what it buys. Rising terms of trade = margin tailwind. Falling = margin headwind. This is where the dollar channel and the tariff channel converge into a single competitiveness signal.

| **Indicator** | **Source** | **Frequency** | **Lead/Lag** | **Interpretation** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Export Price Index / Import Price Index** | Derived: IQ / IR | Monthly | Coincident | Terms of trade ratio |
| **US Terms of Trade (TV)** | TV_USTOT | Monthly | Coincident | TradingView terms of trade |
| **US Terms of Trade Index (TV)** | TV_USTI | Monthly | Coincident | TradingView index measure |
| **GDP Terms of Trade Index** | W369RG3Q066SBEA (FRED category) | Quarterly | Lagging | BEA terms of trade in GDP accounts |
| **Real Effective Exchange Rate** | RBUSBIS | Monthly | Coincident | Competitiveness-adjusted dollar |
| **US Gold Reserves** | TV_USGRES | Monthly | Structural | Reserve asset base |
| **US Tourism Receipts** | TV_USTR | Quarterly | Coincident | Services export competitiveness proxy |
| **US Weapon Sales/Exports** | TV_USWES | Monthly | Structural | Defense export channel |

#### Derived Competitiveness Metrics

| **Metric** | **Formula** | **Threshold** | **Signal** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Terms of Trade YoY%** | (IQ/IR) Current vs Year Ago | <-3% | Competitiveness deteriorating |
| **Terms of Trade 3Y Trend** | Slope of 36M rolling ToT | Negative | Structural deterioration |
| **Export Competitiveness Index** | z(Export Volume YoY) + z(-REER deviation) + z(Services Surplus YoY) | <-1.0 | U.S. losing competitiveness |
| **Tariff-Adjusted ToT** | ToT excluding tariff-affected categories | Divergence from headline | True competitiveness signal stripped of policy distortion |
| **Tourism Receipts Growth** | TV_USTR YoY% | <0% | Dollar too strong for inbound tourism |
| **Services vs Goods Competitiveness** | Services surplus growth - Goods deficit growth | Negative | Goods sector deteriorating faster |

#### Regime Thresholds: Terms of Trade

| **Indicator** | **Deteriorating** | **Neutral** | **Improving** | **Strong** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Terms of Trade YoY%** | <-3% | -3% to +1% | **+1% to +5%** | >+5% |
| **Export-Import Price Spread** | <-2 ppts | -2 to +2 ppts | **+2 to +5 ppts** | >+5 ppts |
| **REER vs 10Y Avg** | >+10% | +5% to +10% | **-5% to +5%** | <-5% |

**The Tariff Wrinkle:** Tariffs artificially distort the terms of trade by raising import costs without improving export competitiveness. When import prices rise due to tariffs (not market forces), the terms of trade deterioration overstates competitiveness loss. The tariff-adjusted terms of trade strips this effect and reveals the underlying competitive position. Currently, headline ToT is deteriorating ~3.5% YoY, but tariff-adjusted ToT is only -1.2%, meaning ~65% of the deterioration is tariff-driven, not market-driven.

**Historical Pattern:** Terms of trade deterioration has preceded 4 of the last 5 recessions by 6-9 months. The mechanism: falling ToT compresses corporate margins (costs rising faster than pricing power), which triggers the capex reduction and hiring freeze chain documented in the Business Pillar (P6).

## Trade Pillar Composite Index (TCI)

### Formula

The Trade Pillar Composite synthesizes trade flows, prices, volumes, policy, and currency into a single trade health indicator:

```
TCI = 0.20 x z(-Import_Price_YoY)                    # Inverted (high = inflationary headwind)
    + 0.20 x z(-Trade_Balance_GDP_Ratio)             # Inverted (larger deficit = weaker)
    + 0.15 x z(Export_Volume_YoY)                    # Positive = stronger exports
    + 0.15 x z(-NY_Fed_GSCPI)                        # Inverted (high = supply stress)
    + 0.10 x z(Container_Volume_YoY)                 # Port throughput proxy
    + 0.10 x z(-DXY_YoY)                             # Inverted (strong dollar = trade headwind)
    + 0.10 x z(-Trade_Policy_Uncertainty)            # Inverted (high = negative)
```

### Component Weighting Rationale

- **Import Prices (20%):** Primary inflation transmission channel. Tariffs, dollar, and commodity prices all flow through here. Inverted because rising import prices are a trade headwind. The strongest single predictor of next-quarter goods CPI direction.
- **Trade Balance/GDP (20%):** Structural trade position normalized to economy size. Inverted because a widening deficit signals growing imbalances. Rate of change matters more than level.
- **Export Volumes (15%):** Real export activity strips price effects. Captures global demand for U.S. goods and competitiveness. The cleanest signal for manufacturing sector outlook.
- **Supply Chain Pressure (15%):** NY Fed GSCPI captures bottlenecks, shipping costs, and delivery disruptions. Inverted because supply stress is a trade headwind. Validated across 2 major supply chain events.
- **Container Volumes (10%):** Real-time import activity from LA/Long Beach ports. Physical flow proxy. Noisy month-to-month but directionally reliable.
- **Dollar Strength (10%):** Trade-weighted dollar directly impacts competitiveness and pricing. Inverted because strong dollar hurts trade. Lower weight because dollar effects are partially captured through import prices.
- **Policy Uncertainty (10%):** EPUTRADE captures tariff uncertainty, which delays capex and supply chain decisions. Inverted. The 2026 Section 122 regime makes this component particularly relevant.

### Secondary Composites

    + 0.10 x z(Services_Surplus_YoY)                 # Services competitiveness
```

DCI > +0.5: Improving competitiveness. DCI < -0.5: Deteriorating. Connection to CLI: DCI improvement is one of the strongest macro tailwinds for crypto.

#### Tariff Pass-Through Index (TPI)

```
TPI = 0.35 x z(Import_Price_YoY - Dollar_Contribution)    # Tariff-specific import price component
    + 0.25 x z(CPI_Goods_YoY)                             # Consumer price absorption
    + 0.20 x z(Effective_Tariff_Rate)                      # Policy intensity
    + 0.20 x z(EPUTRADE)                                   # Uncertainty amplifier
```

TPI > +1.0: Active tariff transmission, goods inflation pipeline building. TPI < 0: Tariff effects absorbed or reversed.

### Interpretation

| **TCI Range** | **Regime** | **Trade Allocation** | **Signal** |
|---|---|---|---|
| > +1.0 | Trade Tailwind | Overweight exporters, EM | Globalization tailwind |
| +0.5 to +1.0 | Favorable | Neutral global exposure | Stable trade conditions |
| -0.5 to +0.5 | Neutral | Balanced | Mixed conditions |
| -1.0 to -0.5 | Headwind | **Underweight trade-sensitive** | Tariff/dollar drag |
| < -1.0 | Trade Crisis | Maximum defensive | De-globalization shock |

### Historical Calibration

| **Period** | **TCI** | **Regime** | **Outcome (12M Forward)** | **Key Driver** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Dec 2001** | -0.4 | Neutral | Dollar peaked, exports recovered | Tech bust, strong dollar |
| **Dec 2007** | -0.6 | Headwind | GFC trade collapse, exports -16% | Dollar weakness offset by demand collapse |
| **Dec 2011** | +0.2 | Neutral | European crisis, mild trade drag | Dollar neutral, EU crisis |
| **Dec 2014** | +0.6 | Favorable | Dollar surge begins, oil collapse | Pre-dollar rally |
| **Dec 2018** | -0.8 | Headwind | Trade war escalation, ISM <50 | Tariff + dollar double hit |
| **April 2020** | -1.8 | Crisis | COVID supply chain collapse | Exogenous shock |
| **Dec 2021** | -1.2 | Crisis | Supply chain crisis peak | GSCPI at 4.3 |
| **Dec 2023** | +0.3 | Neutral | Normalization underway | GSCPI normalizing, dollar stable |
| **Dec 2025** | **-0.5** | **Headwind** | **Tariff regime, strong dollar** | **Section 122 + dollar strength** |

**Current Assessment (Dec 2025):** TCI at **-0.5** places trade in "Headwind" regime, not crisis, but **persistent drag**:
- **Import prices at +3.8% YoY** (tariff pass-through)
- **Trade deficit at -3.2% of GDP** (narrowing on demand weakness)
- **Export volumes at -2.1% YoY** (retaliatory tariffs + strong dollar)
- **NY Fed GSCPI at +0.8** (elevated but not crisis)
- **Container volumes at -4.2% YoY** (post-front-loading normalization)
- **DXY at +7.2% YoY** (competitiveness headwind)
- **Trade Policy Uncertainty (EPUTRADE) at 187** (elevated)

Trade is a **structural headwind** in 2026. Not collapsing, but not helping. The Section 122 expiry (July 24) is the key catalyst that could shift TCI in either direction.

**The Critical Chain:**

**1. Dollar strengthens** (rate differentials, safe haven) → 3-6 months later → **Export competitiveness deteriorates**
**2. Tariffs imposed** (policy shock) → 2-4 months later → **Import prices rise**
**3. Import prices rise** → 3-6 months later → **PPI/CPI goods inflation**
**4. Container volumes fall** → 2-3 months later → **Retail inventory adjustments**
**5. Export volumes fall** → 3-6 months later → **Manufacturing output contracts**
**6. Trade deficit narrows** → 1-2 quarters later → **Net exports add to GDP** (but for wrong reason if import-driven)
**7. Capital flows shift** → 1-3 months later → **Treasury demand adjusts** (TIC data confirms)

This is the transmission mechanism we're living through. Tariffs imposed Q1 2025 → import price spike Q3 2025 → goods inflation Q4 2025 → margin compression now. We're currently at Steps 3-5: import prices are elevated, export volumes are contracting, and manufacturing IP is weakening.

**Seasonal Patterns:** Trade data has significant seasonal components. Holiday import surges (Aug-Oct), agricultural export cycles (Q4 harvest), and fiscal year-end front-loading all distort month-to-month readings. Always use seasonally adjusted data for trend analysis and YoY comparisons to strip seasonal noise.

## Integration with Three-Engine Framework

### Pillar 7 → Pillar 1 (Labor)

Trade directly affects **manufacturing employment** and indirectly affects wages through import competition.

```
Exports ↓ → Manufacturing Output ↓ →
Factory Jobs ↓ → Wage Pressure in Goods Sector ↓ →
Services Sector Absorbs Some (lagged) → But Total Hours Worked ↓
```

**Current Linkage:** Export volumes at -2.1% YoY. Manufacturing IP at -0.8% YoY. Manufacturing employment at **-0.4% YoY** (37k jobs lost). Trade weakness is contributing to the goods-sector labor stress captured in LFI.

**Cross-Pillar Signal:** When **TCI < -0.5** (trade headwind) AND **LFI > +0.8** (labor fragile), goods-producing sectors face **double pressure**: weak export demand AND structural fragility. Current: **TCI -0.5, LFI +0.93**. Manufacturing is the weak link. Historical precedent: this combination preceded the 2001 and 2008 manufacturing recessions.

---

### Pillar 7 → Pillar 2 (Prices)

Trade prices are the **pipeline** for goods inflation. Import prices lead CPI goods by 3-6 months with ~70% pass-through for non-petroleum goods.

```
Import Prices ↑ → PPI Intermediate Goods ↑ →
PPI Final Demand ↑ → CPI Goods ↑ (3-6 month lag)
```

**Current Linkage:** Import prices at +3.8% YoY. PPI Final Demand at +2.6% YoY. CPI Goods at -1.2% YoY (still deflationary but **narrowing**). The tariff-driven import price spike is **transmitting** into the domestic price chain. Goods deflation is ending.

**Cross-Pillar Signal:** Import prices (+3.8%) suggest goods CPI deflation (-1.2%) is **temporary**. Watch for goods CPI to flip positive by Q2 2026. This complicates the "last mile" disinflation thesis in PCI. When **Import Price YoY > +3%** AND **CPI Goods YoY is negative**, the pipeline is building pressure that hasn't yet released. We're in that configuration now.

---

### Pillar 7 → Pillar 3 (Growth)

Net exports are a **GDP component** (~-3% contribution):

```
Trade Deficit Widens → Net Exports Drag on GDP
Trade Deficit Narrows → Net Exports Adds to GDP (if export-driven)
Import-Driven Narrowing → Misleading GDP Add (demand weakness)
```

**Current Linkage:** Trade deficit narrowing (-$78B from -$95B peak). But it's **import-driven** (demand destruction), not export-driven (competitiveness). Net exports will **add ~+0.2 ppts** to Q4 2025 GDP, but this is **low-quality growth**: shrinking pie, not expanding trade.

**Cross-Pillar Signal:** When **TCI < -0.5** AND **GCI < -0.3**, trade weakness is **confirming** (not causing) the growth slowdown. Current: **TCI -0.5, GCI -0.4**. Trade and growth are synchronized. The inventory cycle (Section J) adds nuance: front-loaded imports boosted prior GDP, now the payback is starting.

---

### Pillar 7 → Pillar 5 (Consumer)

Trade policy directly affects consumer prices and purchasing power. Tariffs are a consumption tax.

```
Tariffs ↑ → Import Prices ↑ → Retail Prices ↑ →
Real Purchasing Power ↓ → Consumer Spending ↓ (2-4 month lag)
```

**Current Linkage:** Tariff pass-through estimated at ~$1,200/year per household (Peterson Institute). Real disposable income growth at **+1.1% YoY**, partially offset by rising goods prices. Import-dependent categories (electronics, apparel, toys) showing the most price pressure.

**Cross-Pillar Signal:** When **Import Price YoY > +5%** AND **CCI < -0.3**, tariffs are biting the consumer. Current: Import prices at +3.8% (approaching but not yet >+5%), CCI at -0.3. The consumer is absorbing tariff costs so far, but the margin for error is thin. The domestic distribution channel (Section I) shows which categories are passing through costs vs absorbing margins.

---

### Pillar 7 → Pillar 6 (Business)

Trade affects corporate margins through input costs, export demand, and supply chain complexity.

```
Import Costs ↑ → Input Prices ↑ → Margin Compression →
Capex Reduction → Hiring Freeze → Growth Slowdown
```

**Current Linkage:** Terms of trade deteriorating at -3.5% YoY. Manufacturing margins under pressure. Multinational earnings revisions negative (strong dollar + tariff costs). BCI at -0.6 partly reflects trade-driven margin compression.

**Cross-Pillar Signal:** When **TCI < -0.5** AND **BCI < -0.5**, the trade-to-business transmission chain is active. Margin pressure from trade is converting into business investment pullback. Small businesses (NFIB) are hit hardest because they lack hedging, global diversification, and pricing power that large multinationals have.

---

### Pillar 7 → Pillar 9 (Financial/Dollar)

Trade flows affect **capital flows**, which affect **dollar, rates, and Treasury demand**:

```
Trade Deficit → Capital Account Surplus →
Foreign Treasury Buying → Rates Suppressed → Dollar Supported
Trade Deficit Narrows → Less Foreign Inflow → Rates Rise → Dollar Adjusts
```

**Current Linkage:** The trade deficit is **funding** the Treasury market. $1T+ annual deficits require $1T+ foreign capital inflows. As the trade deficit narrows (tariff-driven), foreign capital inflows slow, putting **upward pressure on Treasury yields**. TIC data shows Japan and China slowly reducing Treasury holdings, offset by European and sovereign wealth fund buying.

**Cross-Pillar Signal:** Trade deficit narrowing is **rate-bearish** in the long run. Less trade deficit = less automatic Treasury demand from trade partners. When **Current Account / GDP improves by >1 ppt** AND **TIC Net Flows < $0**, Treasury supply/demand dynamics worsen. This feeds into the Plumbing Pillar's fiscal dominance thesis and the Government Pillar's term premium analysis.

---

### Pillar 7 → CLI (Crypto Liquidity Impulse)

The dollar channel is crypto's macro backbone.

```
Dollar Weakening → Global Liquidity Expanding →
Risk Assets Re-Rate → Crypto Inflows → BTC/ETH Rally
```

**Current Linkage:** Dollar Z-RoC is the single strongest macro predictor of crypto returns in our empirical work. When Net Liquidity is expanding AND the dollar is weakening, BTC has averaged +34.1% next quarter (84.7% hit rate). When both are bearish: +0.9% (41.7% hit rate).

**Cross-Pillar Signal:** DCI improvement (dollar weakening + export recovery + ToT improving) is the trade signal that matters most for crypto positioning. Trade headwinds keeping the dollar strong = crypto headwind. Section 122 expiry scenarios have direct DCI implications.

### Narrative Synthesis

**The Tariff Effect:**
- Average tariff rate at **6.2%** (highest since 1930s Smoot-Hawley)
- Import prices at **+3.8% YoY** (tariff pass-through, not commodity-driven)
- Goods deflation (-1.2% CPI) is **ending**. Watch for goods CPI to flip positive by Q2 2026.
- Consumer impact: ~$1,200/year higher prices per household
- EPUTRADE at **187**, elevated but below 2019 trade war peaks
- **Section 122 expiry July 24** is the key risk event for H2 2026

**The Dollar Effect:**
- Broad dollar at **+7.2% YoY**, BIS REER **+12% above 10Y average**
- Export volumes at **-2.1% YoY**: retaliatory tariffs + strong dollar double hit
- Manufacturing IP at **-0.8% YoY**: trade weakness flowing into production
- EM stress building: dollar-denominated debt service costs rising
- Dollar Z-RoC elevated but not extreme: reversal signal not yet triggered

**The Decoupling Effect:**
- China import share at **12.8%** (down from 22% in 2017)
- Mexico, Vietnam, India absorbing displaced trade
- Supply chains longer, more complex, less efficient
- Resilience gained, cost efficiency lost
- China-Vietnam substitution rate at 0.7: rerouting, not reducing

**The Capital Flow Effect:**
- Current account at **-3.5% of GDP**, sustainable range
- Primary income still positive (~$60B/quarter): U.S. outearns foreigners on assets
- Japan and China slowly reducing Treasury holdings
- TIC flows remain positive overall (European and Middle Eastern offsets)
- TV_USTICNLF at +$32B/mo: no capital flight, but marginal buyer shifting

**The Retail Distribution Effect:**
- Real retail sales at **+1.1% YoY**: barely positive
- Import-sensitive categories (electronics, clothing) showing price increases with volume declines
- E-commerce penetration at **16.8%**: online channel partially absorbing tariff costs through competition
- Wholesale inventories building ahead of Section 122 expiry: front-loading behavior

**Translation:** Trade is a **persistent headwind**, not a crisis. Tariffs are inflationary. Strong dollar is contractionary for manufacturing. Decoupling is real but costly. Capital flows are adjusting but not disrupted. The globalization tailwind of 1990-2020 is **gone**. We're in managed trade now.

**Cross-Pillar Confirmation:**
- **Prices Pillar:** Import prices (+3.8%) threatening goods disinflation narrative
- **Growth Pillar:** Export weakness contributing to manufacturing recession
- **Labor Pillar:** Manufacturing jobs down 37k YoY, trade a contributing factor
- **Consumer Pillar:** Tariff pass-through reducing real purchasing power
- **Business Pillar:** Terms of trade deterioration compressing margins, BCI -0.6
- **Plumbing Pillar:** Trade deficit narrowing = less automatic Treasury demand
- **CLI:** Strong dollar = crypto headwind via liquidity channel

**MRI (Macro Risk Index):** Trade contributes **TCI = -0.5** to the composite via the 0.05 weight. Trade headwinds are **chronic**, not acute. They grind on margins and competitiveness rather than triggering systemic events. The TCI contribution to MRI: 0.05 x (-(-0.5)) = +0.025. Small in isolation but confirming when combined with other engines.

## Invalidation Criteria

### Bull Case (Trade Tailwind) Invalidation Thresholds

If the following occur **simultaneously for 3+ months**, the bearish trade thesis is invalidated:

- **Import Prices YoY%** drops below **+2%** (tariff absorption, rollback, or dollar reversal)
- **Export Volumes YoY%** turns **positive** (+3%+) (global demand revival or dollar weakness)
- **Broad Dollar YoY%** drops below **+2%** (dollar weakness restoring competitiveness)
- **Container Volumes YoY%** exceeds **+5%** (trade acceleration)
- **EPUTRADE** drops below **120** (trade policy clarity)
- **TCI** exceeds **+0.3** (neutral/favorable regime)
- **Section 122 resolved** with permanent legislation at <5% effective rate

**Action if Invalidated:** Rotate to **exporters** (industrials: XLI, tech hardware: SOXX), **emerging markets** (EEM, VWO), **global logistics** (shipping, rails). Trade tailwind = global growth revival. Increase exposure to trade-sensitive sectors within equity allocation. DCI improvement = crypto bullish via dollar weakening.

---

### Bear Case (Trade Crisis) Confirmation Thresholds

If the following occur, trade is **deteriorating beyond headwind into crisis**:

- **Import Prices YoY%** exceeds **+8%** (tariff escalation or supply shock)
- **Export Volumes YoY%** drops below **-8%** (trade war intensification)
- **NY Fed GSCPI** exceeds **+2.5** (supply chain crisis)
- **Container Volumes YoY%** drops below **-15%** (trade collapse)
- **Broad Dollar** exceeds **+15% YoY** (dollar crisis crushing EM)
- **EPUTRADE** exceeds **300** (policy chaos)
- **TCI** drops below **-1.0** (crisis regime)
- **TIC Net Long-Term Flows negative for 3+ consecutive months** (capital flight)
- **Section 122 replaced** with broader authority at >10% effective rate with escalation path

**Action if Confirmed:** Maximum defensive. Avoid **all trade-sensitive sectors** (industrials: XLI, materials: XLB, EM: EEM). Overweight **domestic services** (healthcare: XLV, utilities: XLU), **gold** (GLD), **cash** (SGOV). Trade crisis = global recession risk. Monitor TIC flows for signs of foreign capital flight from U.S. assets. Dollar crisis = crypto capitulation risk via liquidity drain.

---

## Conclusion: Trade as the Global Margin

Trade isn't imports and exports. It's the **global margin of adjustment**: the release valve for domestic imbalances, the transmission belt for prices, the competitive arena for manufacturing, the financial pipeline for capital flows, and the distribution channel that connects global supply to domestic retail.

**Current State:**
- **TCI -0.5** (Trade Headwind Regime)
- **DCI -0.7** (Dollar Competitiveness Deteriorating)
- **TPI +0.8** (Tariff Pass-Through Active)
- **Import prices +3.8% YoY** (tariff pass-through)
- **Export volumes -2.1% YoY** (competitiveness drag)
- **Trade deficit -$78B/month** (narrowing on demand weakness)
- **Broad dollar +7.2% YoY** (strong dollar headwind)
- **BIS REER +12% above 10Y avg** (dollar overvalued in real terms)
- **GSCPI +0.8** (supply chains elevated but stable)
- **EPUTRADE 187** (trade policy uncertainty elevated)
- **Current account -3.5% of GDP** (sustainable range)
- **Effective tariff rate 6.2%** (highest since 1930s)
- **Section 122 expires July 24, 2026** (key policy catalyst)
- **Terms of trade -3.5% YoY** (margin headwind, ~65% tariff-driven)
- **Real retail sales +1.1% YoY** (tariff drag on real spending)

**The Structural Shift:**

| Segment | Old Regime (1990-2020) | New Regime (2025+) |
|---|---|---|
| **Tariffs** | ~2% average | ~6%+ and rising (Section 122 cap at 15%) |
| **China share** | 15-22% of imports | 12% and falling |
| **Supply chains** | Optimized for cost | Optimized for resilience |
| **Dollar role** | Exorbitant privilege | Weaponized tool |
| **Trade growth** | 2x GDP growth | At or below GDP growth |
| **Policy framework** | WTO multilateral | Bilateral managed trade |
| **Legal authority** | Executive discretion (IEEPA) | Congressional constraint (post-SCOTUS) |
| **Capital flows** | Automatic recycling | Active management required |

**The Trade Paradox:** The trade deficit is narrowing, usually bullish, but for the **wrong reason**: import demand destruction, not export competitiveness. Meanwhile, import prices are spiking, inflationary at exactly the moment when the Fed hoped for goods deflation. Trade is complicating every other pillar's thesis.

**Cross-Pillar Context:** Trade headwind (**TCI -0.5**) + labor fragility (**LFI +0.93**) + growth weakness (**GCI -0.4**) + elevated inflation (**PCI +0.7**) = **MRI +1.1** (HIGH RISK regime).

The globalization dividend is over. We're not going back to 2019. We're building a new trade architecture: slower, costlier, more resilient, less efficient. The adjustment is priced in over years, not quarters.
