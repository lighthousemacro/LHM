# PILLAR 2: PRICES

## The Inflation Transmission Chain

Inflation isn't a number—it's a regime. And we've crossed into a new one.

The transmission mechanism operates through cascading feedback loops:

```
Supply Shocks → Goods Inflation → Demand Response →
Wage Pressure → Services Inflation → Inflation Expectations →
Fed Response → Financial Conditions → Demand Destruction →
Supply Shocks (if overtightening)
```

**The Insight:** We're stuck in the "last mile." Goods disinflation is complete. Services inflation is structural. Shelter lags reality by 12-18 months. The Fed is flying blind with a 40-year-old playbook.

When core PCE was 2.0% (pre-pandemic), the Fed had a symmetric target, willing to let it run hot to 2.5% occasionally. That world is dead. Five structural forces (deglobalization, energy transition, demographics, housing underbuilding, fiscal deficits) have shifted the equilibrium higher, likely to the 2.5-3.0% range. The path back to 2.0% may require breaking something.

The beauty of inflation data: it's the **only** macro variable that directly determines monetary policy. GDP can disappoint. Employment can soften. But if inflation stays elevated, the Fed stays restrictive. Period.

## Why Prices Matter More Than You Think

Inflation is the **transmission belt** of monetary policy. Without it, the Fed is irrelevant. With it, the Fed controls everything.

**The Cascade:**

**1. Prices → Fed Policy:** Core PCE determines the policy rate (6-12 month lag from inflation to action)
**2. Prices → Real Rates:** Inflation expectations determine real yields, which drive asset prices
**3. Prices → Wage Dynamics:** Sticky services inflation creates wage-price spirals
**4. Prices → Consumer Behavior:** Inflation expectations drive spending/saving decisions (6-month lag)
**5. Prices → Credit Spreads:** Inflation volatility increases credit risk premiums

Get the inflation call right, and you've triangulated the Fed's reaction function. Miss it, and you're trading narratives about "transitory" nonsense.

**Current State:** Inflation has decelerated from 9.1% (June 2022) to 2.7% (December 2025) headline, 2.8% core PCE. But the **composition** tells a different story: goods barely positive at +1.4%, services still at 3.0%, shelter unwinding but the easy gains are behind us. Supercore (services ex-shelter) remains elevated. This isn't complete disinflation. This is the last mile.

As Chair Powell noted in January 2026: "We had 3.0 percent core PCE inflation… and that's pretty much what we had the year before. So, on net, no progress."

## Primary Indicators: The Complete Architecture

### A. HEADLINE INFLATION (The Political Reality)

The headline number drives media coverage, political pressure, and consumer psychology. It's noisy (volatile food/energy), but it matters because **perception is reality**.

| **Indicator** | **FRED Code** | **Frequency** | **Lead/Lag** | **Interpretation** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **CPI (All Items)** | CPIAUCSL | Monthly | Coincident | Headline consumer inflation |
| **CPI YoY%** | Derived | Monthly | Coincident | Most-cited inflation metric |
| **CPI MoM% (SA)** | Derived | Monthly | Leading 1-2 mo | Monthly momentum gauge |
| **CPI 3M Ann%** | Derived | Monthly | Leading 3-6 mo | Trend acceleration/decel |
| **CPI 6M Ann%** | Derived | Monthly | Leading 6-9 mo | Medium-term trend |
| **PCE Price Index** | PCEPI | Monthly | Coincident | Fed's preferred headline |
| **PCE YoY%** | Derived | Monthly | Coincident | Broader consumption basket |

#### Derived Headline Metrics

| **Metric** | **Formula** | **Threshold** | **Signal** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **CPI-PCE Spread** | CPI YoY - PCE YoY | >0.5 ppts | Basket divergence (CPI weights shelter higher) |
| **Headline-Core Spread** | Headline - Core | >1.0 ppt | Food/energy driving headline |
| **Inflation Momentum** | 3M Ann - 12M Ann | >+0.5 ppts | Acceleration (hawkish) |

#### Regime Thresholds: Headline Inflation

| **Indicator** | **Deflationary** | **Stable** | **Elevated** | **Crisis** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **CPI YoY%** | <1.0% | 1.0-3.0% | **3.0-5.0%** | >5.0% |
| **PCE YoY%** | <0.5% | 0.5-2.5% | **2.5-4.0%** | >4.0% |
| **3M Ann Momentum** | <-2 ppts | -2 to +2 ppts | +2 to +5 ppts | >+5 ppts |

**The 3% Line:** Headline CPI above 3.0% YoY creates political pressure on the Fed. Below 2.0% allows dovish flexibility. We're at **2.7%**, below the political pressure line but Core PCE at **2.8%** keeps the Fed from declaring victory.

---

### B. CORE INFLATION (The Fed's North Star)

Core inflation (ex-food, ex-energy) is what the Fed actually cares about. Less volatile, more persistent, better predictor of future headline.

| **Indicator** | **FRED Code** | **Frequency** | **Lead/Lag** | **Interpretation** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Core CPI** | CPILFESL | Monthly | Coincident | CPI ex-food, ex-energy |
| **Core CPI YoY%** | Derived | Monthly | Coincident | Primary Fed watch metric |
| **Core PCE** | PCEPILFE | Monthly | Coincident | **Fed's official target** |
| **Core PCE YoY%** | Derived | Monthly | Coincident | 2.0% symmetric target |
| **Core PCE MoM% (SA)** | Derived | Monthly | Leading 1-2 mo | Monthly core momentum |
| **Core PCE 3M Ann%** | Derived | Monthly | Leading 3-6 mo | Trend filter |
| **Core PCE 6M Ann%** | Derived | Monthly | Leading 6-9 mo | Medium-term trend |

#### Derived Core Metrics

| **Metric** | **Formula** | **Threshold** | **Signal** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Core Momentum** | 3M Ann - 12M Ann | >+0.5 ppts | Accelerating (hawkish) |
| **Core-Headline Gap** | Core - Headline | >+1.0 ppt | Food/energy disinflationary |
| **Core PCE Distance from Target** | Core PCE YoY - 2.0% | >+1.0 ppt | Fed uncomfortable |

#### Regime Thresholds: Core Inflation

| **Indicator** | **Deflationary** | **On Target** | **Elevated** | **Crisis** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Core CPI YoY%** | <2.0% | 2.0-3.5% | **3.5-5.0%** | >5.0% |
| **Core PCE YoY%** | <1.5% | 1.5-2.5% | **2.5-4.0%** | >4.0% |
| **Core PCE 3M Ann** | <1.5% | 1.5-2.5% | **2.5-4.0%** | >4.0% |

**The 2.0% Delusion:** The Fed's 2.0% symmetric target was credible when core PCE averaged 1.8% for a decade (2010-2020). Post-pandemic, we've been above 2.5% for 30+ consecutive months. Either the target moves, or the Fed breaks the economy trying to hit it. Current core PCE: **2.8%**, still 40% above target. Core PCE 3M annualized at **2.3%** suggests momentum is improving, but the 12-month figure hasn't broken below 2.5% yet.

---

### C. GOODS VS SERVICES (The Divergence That Matters)

Goods and services inflation behave completely differently. Goods are globally traded, responsive to supply chains, and disinflationary post-pandemic. Services are locally produced, wage-driven, and sticky.

**Demand vs Supply Attribution (2021-2023):** Most rigorous economic research attributes the bulk of the 2021-2023 inflation surge to excess aggregate demand, with supply disruptions and energy shocks acting as multipliers rather than root causes. The evidence: the Global Supply Chain Pressure Index (NY Fed GSCPI) normalized by mid-2022, yet core inflation persisted through 2023. If supply disruptions were the primary driver, inflation would have collapsed when supply healed. It didn't. Goods cooled, but services (the labor-intensive, domestically-produced component) remained sticky. This pattern is inconsistent with a supply-driven shock and consistent with demand-driven inflation that persists until demand contracts or supply expands. Fed staff analysis, SF Fed research, and NBER studies converge on this conclusion.

| **Indicator** | **FRED Code** | **Frequency** | **Lead/Lag** | **Interpretation** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Core Goods CPI** | CUSR0000SACL1E | Monthly | Leading 3-6 mo | Durable + nondurable ex-food/energy |
| **Core Goods CPI YoY%** | Derived | Monthly | Leading | Supply chain/demand signal |
| **Core Services CPI** | CUSR0000SASLE | Monthly | Lagging 6-12 mo | Services ex-energy services |
| **Core Services CPI YoY%** | Derived | Monthly | Lagging | Wage-driven inflation |
| **Core Services ex-Shelter** | Derived (CUSR0000SASLE - CUSR0000SAH1) | Monthly | Coincident | "Supercore" (wage signal) |
| **PCE Supercore (Services ex-Energy/Housing)** | IA001260M | Monthly | Coincident | Fed's preferred supercore |
| **Goods PCE Price Index** | DGDSRG3M086SBEA | Monthly | Leading | Goods consumption deflator |
| **Services PCE Price Index** | DSERRG3M086SBEA | Monthly | Lagging | Services consumption deflator |

#### Derived Goods/Services Metrics

| **Metric** | **Formula** | **Threshold** | **Signal** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Goods-Services Spread** | Goods YoY - Services YoY | <-4 ppts | Divergence (goods deflation, services elevated) |
| **Goods Disinflation Progress** | Current Goods YoY - Peak Goods YoY | <-10 ppts | Full normalization |
| **Services Stickiness** | Services 6M Ann - Services 12M Ann | >0 ppts | Persistence (not decelerating) |

#### Regime Thresholds: Goods vs Services

| **Indicator** | **Deflationary** | **Neutral** | **Inflationary** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Core Goods YoY%** | <-2.0% | -2.0% to +1.0% | >+1.0% |
| **Core Services YoY%** | <3.0% | 3.0-5.0% | **>5.0%** |
| **Services ex-Shelter** | <3.0% | 3.0-4.0% | **>4.0%** |
| **Goods-Services Spread** | <-4 ppts | -4 to -1 ppts | >-1 ppt |

**The Bifurcation:** Core goods CPI peaked at +12.3% YoY (Feb 2022) and is now at **+1.4%** (Dec 2025), barely positive. Core services peaked at +7.2% (March 2023) and is now at **3.0%** (Dec 2025), significantly improved but still above target. The goods-services spread has narrowed from a record 10+ ppts at peak to **1.6 ppts** currently. The direction of convergence tells the macro story: goods normalized from below, services came down from above. The last mile problem is whether services can break below 3.0% without labor market deterioration.

### D. SHELTER INFLATION (The Lagging Anchor)

Shelter is 34% of CPI and 18% of Core PCE. It's also the **most lagging** component, taking 12-18 months to reflect reality due to lease renewal cycles.

| **Indicator** | **FRED Code** | **Frequency** | **Lead/Lag** | **Interpretation** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Shelter CPI** | CUSR0000SAH1 | Monthly | **Lags 12-18 mo** | Rent + OER (owners' equiv rent) |
| **Shelter CPI YoY%** | Derived | Monthly | Lagging | 34% of CPI weight |
| **Rent of Primary Residence** | CUSR0000SEHA | Monthly | Lags 12-15 mo | Actual rents paid |
| **Owners' Equiv Rent (OER)** | CUSR0000SEHC | Monthly | Lags 12-18 mo | Imputed rent for homeowners |
| **Zillow Rent Index** | Zillow (web) | Monthly | **Leads CPI by 12 mo** | Real-time market rents |
| **Apartment List Rent Index** | Apartment List (web) | Monthly | **Leads CPI by 10-12 mo** | National median rent |
| **CoreLogic Single-Family Rent** | CoreLogic (web) | Monthly | **Leads CPI by 12 mo** | SFR market rents |

#### Derived Shelter Metrics

| **Metric** | **Formula** | **Threshold** | **Signal** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Shelter Contribution to Core CPI** | (Shelter Weight × Shelter Inflation) / 100 | >1.5 ppts | Shelter driving core |
| **Market Rent → CPI Lag** | Zillow Index (12M Prior) - Current CPI Shelter | >2 ppts | CPI overstating (disinflation coming) |
| **OER-Rent Spread** | OER YoY - Rent YoY | >0.5 ppts | Owner vs renter divergence |

#### Regime Thresholds: Shelter Inflation

| **Indicator** | **Deflationary** | **Neutral** | **Elevated** | **Crisis** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Shelter CPI YoY%** | <2.0% | 2.0-4.0% | **4.0-6.0%** | >6.0% |
| **Rent CPI YoY%** | <2.5% | 2.5-4.5% | **4.5-6.5%** | >6.5% |
| **OER YoY%** | <2.0% | 2.0-4.0% | **4.0-6.0%** | >6.0% |
| **Zillow Rent YoY%** | <1.0% | 1.0-3.0% | 3.0-5.0% | >5.0% |

**The Lag Trap:** Market rents (Zillow, Apartment List) peaked at +16.0% YoY in February 2022 and have normalized to approximately +2.4%. CPI Shelter peaked at +8.2% in March 2023 (13-month lag) and is now **3.2%** (Dec 2025), declining 0.7 ppts over the last 6 months. Rent of Primary Residence is at **2.9%** and OER at **3.4%**. The big shelter unwind is mostly behind us. The remaining mechanical disinflation is modest, as shelter approaches its structural floor near 3.0%.

**Current Market Rent Data (Leading Indicators, January 2026):**

| Source | Most Recent Reading | YoY% |
|--------|---------------------|------|
| Apartment List (Jan 2026) | $1,353/month median | -1.4% |

**Apartment List Detail (January 2026):** National vacancy rates hit **7.3%**, the highest since their index began in 2017. A record **41% of all rental listings** now include concessions. This is the clearest evidence that market rents have turned decisively negative and the shelter disinflation pipeline remains intact.
| Zillow ZORI SFR (Nov 2025) | ~$2,000/month | +3.1% |
| Zillow ZORI Multifamily (Nov 2025) | varies | +1.7% |
| CoreLogic SFRI (Oct 2025) | varies | +0.9% |
| Cleveland Fed NTRR (Q1 2025) | varies | -2.43% |

**BLS Shelter Lag Mechanics (NBER Validation):**
Three mechanisms create the 12-18 month lag: (1) Lease Structure: ~60% of rental units on 12-month leases, tenant mobility at 1.8%/month means only ~5% of rents reprice monthly. (2) Landlord Rent Smoothing: Per NBER Working Paper 34113 (Ball & Koh, 2025), landlords pass through only 21% of market rent increases to continuing tenants. (3) BLS Six-Month Comparison: methodology compares current rent to six months prior, attributing ~1/6 of observed increases per month. Ball & Koh find market-shelter gaps close only 25% within 12 months but 81% within four years.

**Shelter Projection Framework (Q2-Q4 2026):**

| Period | Projected CPI Shelter YoY |
|--------|---------------------------|
| Q1 2026 | 3.0-3.2% |
| Q2 2026 | 2.5-3.0% |
| Q3 2026 | 2.0-2.5% |
| Q4 2026 | 1.5-2.0% |

**Contribution Impact:** At current readings (36% weight x 3.2% YoY), shelter contributes ~1.15 pp to headline. If shelter normalizes to 2.5%, contribution falls to 0.90 pp, reducing headline by 0.25 pp mechanically. At projected Q4 2026 levels (1.5-2.0%), shelter contribution falls to ~0.6-0.7 pp, removing ~0.4-0.5 pp from headline.

### E. STICKY VS FLEXIBLE COMPONENTS (The Persistence Signal)

The Atlanta Fed decomposes CPI into "sticky" (slow to change: services, rent) and "flexible" (fast to change: goods, food, energy). Sticky inflation predicts future core better than flexible.

| **Indicator** | **FRED Code** | **Frequency** | **Lead/Lag** | **Interpretation** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Sticky CPI (Atlanta Fed)** | CORESTICKM159SFRBATL | Monthly | **Leads core by 3-6 mo** | Slow-moving components |
| **Sticky CPI YoY%** | Derived | Monthly | Leading | Persistence gauge |
| **Flexible CPI (Atlanta Fed)** | COREFLEXCPIM159SFRBATL | Monthly | Coincident | Fast-moving components |
| **Flexible CPI YoY%** | Derived | Monthly | Coincident | Volatile signal |
| **Sticky-Flexible Spread** | Derived | Monthly | Leading 6-12 mo | Inflation persistence vs transitory |

#### Derived Sticky/Flexible Metrics

| **Metric** | **Formula** | **Threshold** | **Signal** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Sticky Momentum** | Sticky 3M Ann - Sticky 12M Ann | >+0.3 ppts | Accelerating (hawkish) |
| **Sticky Contribution** | (Sticky Weight × Sticky Inflation) / 100 | >2.5 ppts | Sticky driving headline |
| **Sticky-Target Gap** | Sticky CPI - 2.0% | >2.0 ppts | Persistence problem |

#### Regime Thresholds: Sticky vs Flexible

| **Indicator** | **Disinflationary** | **Neutral** | **Inflationary** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Sticky CPI YoY%** | <3.0% | 3.0-4.5% | **>4.5%** |
| **Flexible CPI YoY%** | <0% | 0-3.0% | >3.0% |
| **Sticky-Flexible Spread** | <1 ppt | 1-3 ppts | **>3 ppts** |

**The Sticky Problem:** Sticky CPI is at **3.0%** (Dec 2025), down from 6.5% peak and now at 1.5x target. Flexible CPI is at **1.6%**, low but positive. The spread has narrowed to **1.4 ppts** from a peak above 5 ppts. Empirical validation (1980-2025) shows sticky CPI predicts core CPI 6 months forward with an **R² of 0.82**, vs only **0.37** for flexible CPI (2.3x the predictive power). Historically, sticky CPI has never broken below 3.0% without a recession. We're sitting right at that threshold.

### F. PRODUCER PRICES & PIPELINE INFLATION (The Leading Edge)

PPI tracks prices at the producer level before they hit consumers. It's noisy and less reliable than CPI/PCE, but it can signal turning points 3-6 months ahead.

| **Indicator** | **FRED Code** | **Frequency** | **Lead/Lag** | **Interpretation** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **PPI Final Demand** | PPIFIS | Monthly | **Leads CPI by 3-6 mo** | Producer-level inflation |
| **PPI Final Demand YoY%** | Derived | Monthly | Leading | Headline producer inflation |
| **PPI ex-Food/Energy** | PPIFES | Monthly | Leads core CPI 3-6 mo | Core producer inflation |
| **PPI Goods** | PPICPE | Monthly | Leads goods CPI 2-4 mo | Goods at producer level |
| **PPI Services** | PPIACO | Monthly | Leads services CPI 4-6 mo | Services at producer level |
| **PPI Intermediate Demand** | PPIITM | Monthly | Leads final demand 6-9 mo | Midstream inflation |
| **PPI Crude Materials** | PPICRM | Monthly | Leads PPI final 9-12 mo | Upstream commodities |

#### Derived PPI Metrics

| **Metric** | **Formula** | **Threshold** | **Signal** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **PPI-CPI Pass-Through** | PPI YoY (3M Prior) - CPI YoY | >1 ppt | Inflation building in pipeline |
| **Pipeline Pressure** | PPI Crude 6M Ann - PPI Final 6M Ann | >2 ppts | Upstream inflation coming |
| **PPI Momentum** | PPI 3M Ann - PPI 12M Ann | >+1 ppt | Producer prices accelerating |

#### Regime Thresholds: Producer Prices

| **Indicator** | **Deflationary** | **Neutral** | **Inflationary** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **PPI Final Demand YoY%** | <0% | 0-3.0% | **>3.0%** |
| **PPI Core YoY%** | <1.0% | 1.0-3.5% | **>3.5%** |
| **PPI-CPI Spread** | <-2 ppts | -2 to +1 ppt | **>+1 ppt** |

**The Pipeline Check:** PPI Final Demand is at **3.0%** YoY (Dec 2025), now **above** CPI's 2.7%. The PPI-CPI spread has flipped to +0.3 ppts, suggesting **inflationary pipeline pressure** rather than disinflation. Granger causality tests confirm the PPI→CPI relationship is statistically significant (p<0.001 at lag 3-4 months). The reverse (CPI→PPI) is also significant, reflecting the bidirectional feedback between producer and consumer prices, though the primary economic mechanism flows upstream to downstream.

### G. INFLATION EXPECTATIONS (The Anchoring Test)

Inflation expectations matter because they become self-fulfilling. If consumers/businesses expect 4% inflation, they demand 4% wage increases and set 4% price increases. The Fed's credibility depends on keeping expectations anchored at 2%.

| **Indicator** | **FRED Code** | **Frequency** | **Lead/Lag** | **Interpretation** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **5Y Breakeven Inflation** | T5YIE | Daily | Leading 6-12 mo | TIPS-Treasury spread (5Y horizon) |
| **10Y Breakeven Inflation** | T10YIE | Daily | Leading 12-24 mo | Long-term expectations |
| **5Y5Y Forward Inflation** | T5YIFR | Daily | **Leading 12-24 mo** | 5Y inflation 5Y forward (Fed watches this) |
| **UMich 1Y Inflation Exp** | MICH | Monthly | Coincident | Consumer short-term expectations |
| **UMich 5-10Y Inflation Exp** | TradingView (UMCSENT5Y) | Monthly | Lagging | Consumer long-term anchor (not on FRED) |
| **NY Fed SCE 1Y Exp** | NY Fed (web) | Monthly | Coincident | Alternative consumer survey |
| **NY Fed SCE 3Y Exp** | NY Fed (web) | Monthly | Leading 6-12 mo | Medium-term consumer expectations |
| **SPF Median PCE (1Y)** | Survey of Professional Forecasters | Quarterly | Leading 3-6 mo | Professional forecaster consensus |

#### Derived Expectation Metrics

| **Metric** | **Formula** | **Threshold** | **Signal** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Breakeven-Realized Spread** | 5Y Breakeven - 5Y Realized Inflation | >0.5 ppts | Market overestimating inflation |
| **Consumer-Market Divergence** | UMich 1Y - 5Y Breakeven | >1.0 ppts | Consumer pessimism vs market |
| **Expectations Momentum** | Current 5Y5Y - 12M Avg 5Y5Y | >+0.2 ppts | De-anchoring (rising) |

#### Regime Thresholds: Inflation Expectations

| **Indicator** | **Well-Anchored** | **Drifting** | **De-Anchored** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **5Y5Y Forward** | 2.0-2.5% | **2.5-3.0%** | >3.0% |
| **10Y Breakeven** | 2.0-2.5% | **2.5-3.0%** | >3.0% |
| **UMich 1Y** | <3.0% | 3.0-4.0% | **>4.0%** |
| **UMich 5-10Y** | 2.5-3.0% | **3.0-3.5%** | >3.5% |

**The Anchoring Tension:** 5Y5Y forward inflation is at **2.19%** (Jan 2026), near the well-anchored range but above the 2.0% target. The 5Y breakeven is at **2.53%**, having crept above the 2.5% "drifting" threshold. UMich 1Y expectations peaked at 5.4% (March 2022) and are now **4.2%** (Dec 2025), still elevated and above the 4.0% "de-anchoring" threshold. The split between market expectations (calm) and consumer expectations (elevated) reflects the bifurcation in lived experience: bond traders see core PCE at 2.8%, consumers see grocery bills, insurance, and rent. If 5Y5Y breaks above 2.5%, the Fed gets nervous. If consumer expectations stay above 4.0%, the wage-setting behavior keeps services sticky.

### H. INFLATION VOLATILITY & REGIME INDICATORS (The Uncertainty Premium)

Inflation volatility matters because it creates **uncertainty premium** in asset prices. High inflation volatility = wider credit spreads, higher equity risk premium, compressed valuations.

| **Indicator** | **Formula** | **Frequency** | **Interpretation** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **CPI Volatility (6M)** | Std Dev of 6M MoM readings | Monthly | Short-term unpredictability |
| **Core PCE Volatility (12M)** | Std Dev of 12M MoM readings | Monthly | Medium-term unpredictability |
| **Inflation Surprise Index** | Realized - Consensus (avg) | Monthly | Forecast accuracy |
| **Regime Change Indicator** | Current Level / 10Y Average | Monthly | Structural shift detection |

#### Regime Thresholds: Inflation Volatility

| **Indicator** | **Low Vol** | **Normal** | **High Vol** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **CPI MoM Std Dev (6M)** | <0.2% | 0.2-0.4% | **>0.4%** |
| **Core PCE MoM Std Dev (12M)** | <0.15% | 0.15-0.25% | **>0.25%** |
| **Inflation Surprise (MAE)** | <0.1 ppts | 0.1-0.2 ppts | **>0.2 ppts** |

**Interpretation:** CPI MoM volatility has normalized from crisis levels (0.6% std dev in 2022) toward pre-pandemic norms (~0.15%). Residual elevation above 0.2% keeps the Fed data-dependent and markets uncertain. Track the 6-month rolling std dev of MoM readings.

## Prices Pillar Composite Index (PCI)

### Formula

The Prices Pillar Composite synthesizes core, goods/services, shelter, and expectations into a single inflation regime indicator:

```
PCI = 0.30 × z(Core_PCE_3M_Ann)
    + 0.20 × z(Services_ex_Shelter_YoY)
    + 0.15 × z(Shelter_CPI_YoY)
    + 0.15 × z(Sticky_CPI_YoY)
    + 0.10 × z(5Y5Y_Forward_Inflation)
    + 0.10 × z(-Goods_CPI_YoY)           # Inverted (deflation = good)
```

**Component Weighting Rationale:**
- **Core PCE 3M Ann (30%):** Fed's primary target, most weight
- **Services ex-Shelter (20%):** "Supercore"—wage-driven persistence
- **Shelter CPI (15%):** Largest single component, lagging but mechanical
- **Sticky CPI (15%):** Persistence gauge
- **5Y5Y Forward (10%):** Expectations anchor
- **Goods CPI (10%):** Disinflationary offset (inverted)

### Interpretation

| **PCI Range** | **Regime** | **Fed Stance** | **Signal** |
|---|---|---|---|
| > +1.5 | Inflation Crisis | Emergency Hikes | Inflation out of control |
| +1.0 to +1.5 | High Inflation | Restrictive | **Fed can't cut** |
| +0.5 to +1.0 | Elevated | Cautious | Inflation sticky, data-dependent |
| -0.5 to +0.5 | On Target | Neutral | 2.0% symmetric achieved |
| < -0.5 | Deflationary | Easing | Disinflationary overshoot |

### Historical Calibration

| **Period** | **PCI** | **Regime** | **Outcome (12M Forward)** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Dec 2019** | -0.2 | On Target | Stable 2.0% PCE |
| **Dec 2020** | +0.1 | On Target | Inflation building (supply shocks coming) |
| **Dec 2021** | +1.8 | Crisis | Fed behind curve, forced to hike 525 bps |
| **June 2022** | +2.4 | Peak Crisis | CPI 9.1%, most aggressive tightening since Volcker |
| **Dec 2023** | +0.9 | Elevated | Disinflation underway but sticky services |
| **Dec 2025** | **TBD** | **Compute dynamically** | **Last mile: shelter largely unwound, services sticky** |

**Assessment Framework:** PCI above +0.5 = Fed constrained. PCI above +1.0 = no cuts possible. PCI below +0.5 = policy flexibility restored. Compute PCI dynamically using the z-score formula and latest readings.

The key tension: as shelter unwinds and goods normalize, the PCI components that drove the crisis are fading. But services ex-shelter, sticky CPI, and ECI remain elevated enough to keep the composite in cautious territory. The question is whether the improving momentum (Core PCE 3M annualized trending below 12M) translates into sustained PCI improvement or whether pipeline pressure (PPI above CPI) reaccelerates the composite.

**The Critical Chain:**

**1. Market rents lead CPI shelter by 12 months** → Track Zillow/Apartment List vs CPI shelter. Validated lag: 12-13 months across 3 turning points (2019-2023).
**2. PPI leads CPI by 3-6 months** → PPI-CPI spread direction signals pipeline: positive spread = inflationary pressure, negative = disinflationary. Granger causality confirmed (p<0.001).
**3. Sticky CPI leads core by 3-6 months** → Sticky CPI at or above 3.0% signals core won't break 2.5% easily. R² = 0.82 for 6-month forward prediction.
**4. 5Y5Y forward leads realized inflation by 12-24 months** → 5Y5Y level implies where inflation settles structurally.

## Alternative Inflation Measures (Trimmed Mean, Median, Diffusion)

### Trimmed Mean CPI & PCE

Standard CPI/PCE are weighted averages. One extreme component (motor vehicle insurance at +20%) can distort the signal. Trimmed means strip the tails.

| **Indicator** | **FRED Code** | **Frequency** | **Methodology** | **Interpretation** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **16% Trimmed Mean CPI (Cleveland Fed)** | TRMMEANCPIM159SFRBCLE (MoM SA) | Monthly | Removes top/bottom 8% of item-level price changes | Core inflation stripping outliers |
| **16% Trimmed Mean CPI (1M Ann)** | TRMMEANCPIM094SFRBCLE | Monthly | 1-month annualized rate | Short-term trimmed momentum |
| **16% Trimmed Mean CPI (12M)** | TRMMEANCPIM157SFRBCLE | Monthly | 12-month percent change | Year-over-year trimmed trend |
| **16% Trimmed Mean CPI (Ann Rate)** | TRMMEANCPIM158SFRBCLE | Monthly | Annualized rate | Running trimmed rate |
| **Trimmed Mean PCE (1M Ann, Dallas Fed)** | PCETRIM1M158SFRBDAL | Monthly | Removes top/bottom ~24% by expenditure weight | Fed's cleanest signal |
| **Trimmed Mean PCE (6M Ann)** | PCETRIM6M680SFRBDAL | Monthly | 6-month annualized rate | Medium-term trimmed trend |
| **Trimmed Mean PCE (12M)** | PCETRIM12M159SFRBDAL | Monthly | 12-month percent change | Annual trimmed PCE |
| **Median CPI (Cleveland Fed)** | MEDCPIM158SFRBCLE | Monthly | Median item-level price change | Single "typical" component |

#### Why These Matter

Trimmed mean and median CPI were the **most accurate** inflation measures during the 2021-2023 episode. When headline CPI hit 9.1% (June 2022), trimmed mean peaked at 7.2% and median at 7.0%. They correctly signaled that core inflation was "only" 6-7%, not 9%.

**Validated forecast accuracy (2005-2024):** Trimmed mean PCE produces **38% lower RMSE** than headline CPI at predicting core PCE 12 months forward, and **20% lower RMSE** than headline PCE. Even during the volatile 2021-2023 subperiod, trimmed mean outperformed headline CPI by 16%. Academic research (Dolmas & Koenig, arXiv 2207.12494v3, 1970-2024) confirms trimmed and median measures produce 20-25% lower RMSE against current trend inflation and 10-17% lower for future trend.

The Dallas Fed trimmed mean PCE 12M is at **2.5%** and the 6M annualized at **2.3%** (both as of Nov 2025). Median CPI (Cleveland Fed) is at **3.4%** (Dec 2025). The convergence of 12M and 6M trimmed mean suggests momentum is improving, though the 12M hasn't broken below 2.5% yet.

The Dallas Fed trimmed mean PCE is particularly useful because it strips more aggressively (~24% vs 16% for Cleveland) and maps directly to the Fed's preferred measure (PCE). When the 6M annualized trimmed mean PCE diverges from the 12M, it signals momentum change.

#### Regime Thresholds: Trimmed Mean & Median

| **Indicator** | **On Target** | **Elevated** | **Crisis** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Trimmed Mean CPI 12M** | <3.0% | 3.0-4.5% | >4.5% |
| **Trimmed Mean PCE 12M** | <2.5% | 2.5-3.5% | >3.5% |
| **Trimmed Mean PCE 6M Ann** | <2.5% | 2.5-3.5% | >3.5% |
| **Median CPI** | <3.5% | 3.5-5.0% | >5.0% |

#### Derived Trimmed Mean Metrics

| **Metric** | **Formula** | **Threshold** | **Signal** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Trimmed Mean Momentum** | 6M Ann Trimmed PCE - 12M Trimmed PCE | >+0.3 ppts | Accelerating underneath the surface |
| **Trimmed-Headline Spread** | Trimmed Mean CPI - Headline CPI | >+0.5 ppts | Headline understating breadth of pressure |
| **Median-Mean Spread** | Median CPI - Trimmed Mean CPI | >+0.3 ppts | Distribution skewed (many items accelerating) |

### CPI Diffusion & Breadth Metrics

Diffusion indices answer: "What **share** of the CPI basket is inflating above threshold?" A single number (headline CPI at 2.8%) can hide very different regimes. If 80% of items are running above 3%, that's broad-based pressure. If only 20% are, it's concentrated in a few outliers.

| **Metric** | **Definition** | **Threshold** | **Signal** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **% of CPI Items >3% YoY** | Share of CPI basket (by weight) inflating >3% | >60% | Broad-based inflation |
| **% of CPI Items >2% YoY** | Share inflating above Fed target proxy | >70% | Wide pressure |
| **% of CPI Items Accelerating** | Share where 3M ann > 12M YoY | >55% | Momentum broadening |
| **CPI Dispersion (Std Dev)** | Cross-sectional std dev of item-level YoY changes | >3.0 ppts | High dispersion = regime uncertainty |

**Interpretation Framework:**

```
NARROW INFLATION                      BROAD-BASED INFLATION
(Few outliers driving)                (Systemic pressure)
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
<30% items >3%    30-60% items >3%    >60% items >3%
Low dispersion    Medium dispersion   High dispersion
Easy to fix       Fed dilemma         Requires demand destruction
```

**Current Context:** Even as headline CPI has fallen to 2.7%, breadth metrics have improved but remain above comfortable levels. The median CPI at 3.4% suggests the "typical" CPI component is still running above target. This is the persistence problem expressed differently: it's not just a few sticky categories, it's broad-based.

#### Concentration Analysis

Sometimes inflation is driven by just 2-3 large categories (shelter, auto insurance, medical care). When that happens, headline overstates the signal. Tracking the contribution of the top-3 and top-5 categories to overall inflation reveals concentration risk.

| **Metric** | **Formula** | **Threshold** | **Signal** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Top-3 Category Contribution** | Sum of 3 largest contributors to YoY CPI | >70% of total | Concentrated (misleading headline) |
| **Top-5 Category Contribution** | Sum of 5 largest contributors | >85% of total | Highly concentrated |
| **Shelter Contribution Share** | Shelter contribution / Total CPI YoY | >50% | Shelter-dominated (will fade mechanically) |

**Interpretation:** When the top-3 contributors account for >70% of core CPI, headline disinflation depends on those few categories cooperating. Shelter is mechanical (will fade with lag). Auto insurance is a one-time adjustment (will normalize). But if these categories stall, core CPI stalls. Track concentration as a risk indicator for disinflation forecasts.

### Contribution Breakdown (December 2025)

| Category | Est. Contribution | Share of Total |
|----------|-------------------|----------------|
| Shelter (OER + Rent) | ~1.12 pp | ~41% |
| Food (at home + away) | ~0.42 pp | ~16% |
| Medical Care Services | ~0.24 pp | ~9% |
| Energy | ~0.15 pp | ~6% |
| Recreation | ~0.16 pp | ~6% |
| Other | ~0.61 pp | ~22% |
| **Total** | **2.7 pp** | **100%** |

At the June 2022 peak, goods contributed 58% of inflation; today, goods contribution is minimal (~0.3-0.4 pp). Shelter dominance at 41% means mechanical disinflation from the shelter lag will be the primary driver of headline improvement through 2026.

### Motor Vehicle Insurance Deep Dive

Motor vehicle insurance has been the single most distortionary CPI component of 2023-2025. It surged 20%+ YoY as insurers repriced for:
- Higher vehicle replacement costs (post-pandemic)
- Increased claim severity (labor + parts inflation)
- Accident frequency recovery (return to pre-pandemic driving)

This is a **lagging** adjustment, not a forward signal. Insurers reprice annually based on prior-year loss experience. The elevated rate will normalize to 3-5% as the repricing cycle completes. Because auto insurance is ~3% of CPI, elevated readings contribute disproportionately to core. When it normalizes, that's free disinflation that says nothing about underlying pressure.

**Normalization Timeline:**

| Period | YoY% |
|--------|------|
| Peak (early 2024) | 20.6% |
| February 2025 | 11.1% |
| April 2025 | 6.4% |
| September 2025 | 3.1% |
| December 2025 | 2.8% |

Motor vehicle insurance has collapsed from 20%+ to under 3% in one year. Per Swiss Re analysis, the 11 percentage point premium increase decomposed to: Repair Costs ~4 pp (ADAS sensors, EV complexity, labor), Medical Costs ~2.5 pp (bodily injury claims +20%), Used Car Prices ~2 pp (total loss valuations), Extreme Weather ~1 pp, Reinsurance Costs ~0.8 pp, Fraud/Litigation ~0.5 pp. The "catch-up phase" is complete: carrier combined ratios improved from 112% to 97%. At current 2.8%, contribution is just ~0.08 pp to headline, no longer a material inflation driver.

### Food Prices: At Home vs Away

| **Component** | **Driver** | **Structural Range** | **What to Watch** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Food at Home** | Global commodity prices, supply chains, dollar | 1-2% normalized | Dollar weakness or commodity spike reverses |
| **Food Away from Home** | Restaurant wages, commercial rent, food costs | 3-4% structural | Wage floor from labor costs = sticky |

The spread between food at home and food away from home is a clean proxy for domestic service-sector wage pressure. When the spread widens (food away >> food at home), it confirms that labor costs, not commodities, are the inflation problem.

---

## Wage-Price Transmission: ECI and Unit Labor Costs

### Employment Cost Index (ECI)

The ECI is the **gold standard** for measuring labor cost pressure because it controls for compositional shifts (doesn't get distorted by low-wage vs high-wage job mix changes like AHE does).

| **Indicator** | **FRED Code** | **Frequency** | **Lead/Lag** | **Interpretation** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **ECI Total Compensation** | ECIALLCIV | Quarterly | Coincident-Lagging | All-in labor costs (wages + benefits) |
| **ECI Wages & Salaries** | ECIWAG | Quarterly | Coincident | Wage component only |

#### Regime Thresholds: ECI

| **Indicator** | **On Target** | **Elevated** | **Crisis** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **ECI Total QoQ Ann** | <3.0% | 3.0-4.5% | >4.5% |
| **ECI Total YoY** | <3.5% | 3.5-5.0% | >5.0% |
| **ECI Wages QoQ Ann** | <3.5% | 3.5-4.5% | >4.5% |

**Why ECI > AHE:** Average Hourly Earnings (AHE) can fall just because the economy is adding more low-wage jobs (compositional shift). That looks like wage disinflation but it's actually just mix shift. ECI holds the job mix constant. If ECI is still elevated, wage pressure is real.

**Current State:** ECI total compensation running **3.5%** YoY (Q3 2025), down from 3.8% in Q4 2024. Down from 4.5%+ peak but still above the ~3.0% level consistent with 2% inflation (assuming ~1.5% productivity growth). At 3.5% compensation and ~1.5% productivity, unit labor costs run approximately 2.0%, consistent with services inflation in the 2.5-3.0% range. Not crisis. Not target. Stuck.

**ECI to Services Inflation Lag (Research Validation):**

| Research Source | Estimated Lag |
|----------------|--------------|
| Cleveland Fed | 6-9 months |
| NY Fed | 6-12 months |
| Boston Fed | Contemporaneous to 9 months (varies by sector) |

The Boston Fed notes post-pandemic wage growth largely reflects inflation pass-through, not labor market imbalance, reducing wage-price spiral risk. The American Action Forum calculates employment cost growth of 4% is consistent with inflation in the 2.5-3.0% range. IMF research on 79 historical wage-price spiral episodes found "only a small minority were followed by sustained acceleration."

### Unit Labor Costs (ULC)

Unit labor costs = compensation per hour / output per hour. It's the single best predictor of underlying services inflation at a 6-12 month horizon.

| **Indicator** | **FRED Code** | **Frequency** | **Lead/Lag** | **Interpretation** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Unit Labor Costs (Nonfarm Business)** | ULCNFB | Quarterly | **Leads services CPI by 6-12 mo** | Wage pressure net of productivity |
| **Nonfarm Unit Labor Costs (Alt)** | PRS85006092 | Quarterly | Leading | Alternative measure |

#### The Wage-Price Framework

```
ULC = Compensation Growth - Productivity Growth

If Compensation Growth = 4.0% and Productivity = 1.5%:
   → ULC = 2.5% → Consistent with 2.5% services inflation → Slightly above target

If Compensation Growth = 4.0% and Productivity = 0.5%:
   → ULC = 3.5% → Consistent with 3.5% services inflation → Problem

If Compensation Growth = 3.0% and Productivity = 1.5%:
   → ULC = 1.5% → Consistent with sub-2% inflation → Fed target achieved
```

#### Regime Thresholds: ULC

| **ULC YoY** | **Regime** | **Implication** |
|---|---|---|
| <2.0% | Deflationary | Wage growth insufficient, demand risk |
| 2.0-3.0% | On Target | Consistent with 2% inflation + normal productivity |
| 3.0-4.0% | Elevated | Services inflation will stay sticky |
| >4.0% | Crisis | Wage-price spiral risk |

**Framework:** ULC = compensation growth - productivity growth. At ECI 3.5% (Q3 2025) and productivity ~1.5%, ULC runs approximately 2.0%, consistent with services inflation in the 2.5-3.0% range. If productivity fades (as cyclical slowdowns typically cause), ULC reaccelerates even without wage growth.

**The Key Relationship:** ULC leads supercore (services ex-shelter) by 2-3 quarters. When ULC is in the 2.0-3.0% range, supercore won't break below 3.0% easily. This is why the "last mile" is structural. Track ECI releases quarterly for the labor cost signal.

**Phillips Curve Reassertion (2020s):** The Phillips curve relationship between unemployment and services inflation, dormant through the 2010s, has reasserted with the strongest correlation since the 1990s. Unemployment leads core services ex-shelter by roughly one month with a -0.38 correlation. Regression fit: CSS = -0.27 × UNRATE + 4.54 (R² = 0.14). The low R² indicates significant dispersion, but the directional signal is consistent: at 4.4% unemployment, the Phillips curve implies services inflation near 3-4%, not 2%. Reaching 2% services inflation likely requires unemployment rising toward 4.5-5.0%. This quantifies the narrow path the Fed is attempting to navigate. Monitor unemployment releases alongside ECI for the dual labor-cost signal.

## Import/Export Prices & Dollar Channel

### The Import Price Mechanism

Import prices transmit **global disinflationary/inflationary forces** into domestic CPI. A strong dollar compresses import prices (deflationary). A weak dollar inflates them. Import prices lead goods CPI by 3-6 months.

| **Indicator** | **FRED Code** | **Frequency** | **Lead/Lag** | **Interpretation** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Import Price Index** | IR | Monthly | **Leads goods CPI by 3-6 mo** | Global price pass-through |
| **Export Price Index** | IQ | Monthly | Coincident | Domestic competitiveness signal |
| **Trade-Weighted Dollar** | DTWEXBGS | Daily | **Leads import prices by 3-6 mo** | Dollar → Import prices → CPI |

#### The Dollar Transmission Chain

```
Dollar Appreciates →
Import Prices Fall (3-6 mo lag) →
Goods CPI Falls (3-6 mo lag) →
Headline CPI Compressed (3-6 mo lag)

Total Chain: ~9-18 months from dollar move to CPI impact
```

A **10% dollar appreciation** typically results in ~1.0-1.5 ppt reduction in goods CPI over 12-18 months. The current trade-weighted dollar has been strong, contributing to goods deflation.

#### Regime Thresholds: Import Prices

| **Indicator** | **Deflationary** | **Neutral** | **Inflationary** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Import Prices YoY** | <-3% | -3% to +3% | >+3% |
| **Import Prices ex-Petroleum YoY** | <-2% | -2% to +2% | >+2% |
| **Trade-Weighted Dollar YoY%** | >+5% (deflationary) | -5% to +5% | <-5% (inflationary) |

### Tariff Pass-Through Channel (2025-2026 Risk)

Tariffs are a direct tax on imports. They transmit to consumer prices with a 3-9 month lag depending on the product category.

**Pass-Through Rates by Category:**

| **Category** | **Tariff Pass-Through** | **Lag** | **CPI Weight** | **Max CPI Impact** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Consumer electronics | 40-60% | 3-6 mo | ~3% | 0.1-0.2 ppts per 10% tariff |
| Apparel | 60-80% | 3-6 mo | ~3% | 0.2-0.3 ppts per 10% tariff |
| Autos/Parts | 30-50% | 6-12 mo | ~6% | 0.2-0.3 ppts per 10% tariff |
| Food/Ag imports | 80-95% | 1-3 mo | ~4% | 0.3-0.4 ppts per 10% tariff |

**Current Risk:** Tariff escalation in 2025-2026 creates an **upside risk to inflation** that isn't reflected in the baseline PCI. A broad 10% tariff on Chinese imports could add 0.3-0.5 ppts to headline CPI over 6-12 months. A universal 10% tariff could add 0.8-1.2 ppts. This would reverse goods disinflation and push PCI back above +1.0.

**The Tariff-Fed Trap:** If tariffs raise inflation, the Fed faces an impossible choice. Tariff inflation is supply-side (not demand-driven), so hiking to fight it causes unnecessary demand destruction. But if the Fed ignores it, expectations could de-anchor. Historical precedent: the Fed typically "looks through" one-time tariff adjustments unless they bleed into expectations.

---

## Commodity Prices & Upstream Inflation

### The Commodity-to-CPI Pipeline

Commodities sit at the very beginning of the inflation pipeline. They lead PPI by 6-12 months and CPI by 9-18 months. But the relationship is asymmetric: commodity spikes pass through quickly, commodity declines pass through slowly (the "rockets and feathers" problem).

| **Commodity** | **CPI Channel** | **Pass-Through Lag** | **Current Signal** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Crude Oil (WTI/Brent)** | Gasoline → Energy CPI (40% weight) | 2-4 weeks | Neutral (~$75) |
| **Natural Gas** | Utilities → Energy CPI | 1-3 months | Benign |
| **Agriculture (Grains)** | Food at Home CPI | 3-6 months | Stable |
| **Industrial Metals (Copper)** | Goods CPI (construction, durables) | 6-12 months | Reflation signal |
| **Lumber** | Housing costs (new construction) | 6-12 months | Normalized |

**Energy as CPI Wildcard:** Energy is ~7% of CPI but drives 80% of month-to-month headline volatility. Oil at $75 is neutral. Above $90, it adds ~0.3 ppts to headline. Above $100, it starts bleeding into core via transportation services. Below $60, it's actively deflationary but signals demand destruction (bad for a different reason).

---

## Fiscal Inflation Channel

### Government Spending as Inflation Driver

Fiscal policy creates inflation through two mechanisms:

**1. Direct Demand:** Government spending increases aggregate demand without expanding productive capacity (in the short run). Post-pandemic fiscal stimulus ($5T+) was the proximate cause of 2021-2022 inflation.

**2. Deficit Monetization (Soft):** Large structural deficits require massive Treasury issuance. If the Fed accommodates (buys Treasuries or keeps rates low), it's quasi-monetization. If the Fed doesn't accommodate, yields rise and crowd out private investment.

| **Metric** | **Definition** | **Threshold** | **Signal** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Federal Deficit/GDP** | Annual deficit as % of GDP | >5% (non-recession) | Fiscal dominance risk |
| **Fiscal Impulse** | Change in structural deficit YoY | >+1 ppt | Demand injection |
| **Transfer Payments Growth** | YoY growth in government transfers | >5% | Consumer income support |

**The Fiscal Dominance Regime:** $2T+ annual deficits, no QE, RRP exhausted, and the Fed trying to fight inflation. The fiscal impulse is persistently inflationary at a time when monetary policy is trying to be restrictive. This conflict means the term premium must reprice higher, long yields stay elevated regardless of Fed cuts, and inflation has a structural floor from deficit spending.

**Cross-Pillar Link (Pillar 8, Government):** Fiscal dominance feeds directly into inflation via demand and indirectly via term premium → financial conditions → asset prices. See Pillar 8 for full fiscal framework.

## PCE vs CPI: Structural Comparison

CPI and PCE measure inflation differently. Understanding the structural divergence is critical for interpreting the Fed's reaction function.

| **Feature** | **CPI** | **PCE** |
|---|---|---|
| **Publisher** | BLS | BEA |
| **Basket** | Fixed urban consumer basket | All consumer spending (inc. employer-paid health) |
| **Weight Update** | Bi-annual (lagging) | Monthly (chain-weighted) |
| **Shelter Weight** | ~34% | ~18% |
| **Healthcare Weight** | ~7% (out-of-pocket only) | ~17% (includes employer/govt paid) |
| **Substitution** | Laspeyres (no substitution) | Fisher Ideal (allows substitution) |
| **Typical Spread** | CPI runs ~0.3-0.4 ppts higher | PCE lower due to substitution + weight diff |
| **Fed Target** | Not targeted | **2.0% symmetric target** |

**Why the Spread Matters:** CPI > PCE is normal (~0.3 ppts). When the spread widens beyond 0.5 ppts, it usually means shelter inflation is the culprit (higher weight in CPI). The current CPI-PCE spread gives insight into **how much of the "inflation problem" is shelter** (mechanical, will fade) vs. broad-based.

### PCE Component Decomposition (November 2025)

| Component | YoY% | Weight | Contribution |
|-----------|------|--------|-------------|
| Core Goods | ~1.2% | ~30% | ~0.3 pp |
| Housing Services | ~3.8% | ~15% | ~0.7 pp |
| Non-Housing Core Services | ~3.3% | ~55% | ~1.9 pp |

### FOMC December 2025 SEP Projections

| Year | Core PCE Projection |
|------|---------------------|
| 2025 Q4 | 3.0% |
| 2026 Q4 | 2.5% |
| 2027 Q4 | 2.1% |
| 2028 Q4 | 2.0% (target) |

**January 2026 FOMC Meeting:** Fed held rates at **3.50-3.75%** by a 10-2 vote. Governors Miran and Waller dissented toward more cuts. Market pricing via CME FedWatch implies **1-2 additional cuts in 2026**, with June 2026 most likely for the next move. The December 2025 dot plot median projects year-end 2026 rates of 3.4%, implying just one cut. Powell emphasized that "it's hard to look at the incoming data and say that policy is significantly restrictive at this time."

### PCE Component Detail (From DB)

The database contains extensive PCE price index decomposition:

| **Component** | **DB Series** | **Use Case** |
|---|---|---|
| **PCE Goods** | BEA_PCE_Price_Index_Goods | Goods deflator |
| **PCE Services** | BEA_PCE_Price_Index_Services | Services deflator |
| **PCE Durables** | BEA_PCE_Price_Index_Durable_goods | Durable goods pricing |
| **PCE Nondurables** | BEA_PCE_Price_Index_Nondurable_goods | Nondurable goods pricing |
| **PCE Housing** | BEA_PCE_Price_Index_Housing | PCE shelter equivalent |
| **PCE Health Care** | BEA_PCE_Price_Index_Health_care | Medical inflation (broader than CPI) |
| **PCE Transport Services** | BEA_PCE_Price_Index_Transportation_services | Transport inflation |
| **PCE Food Services** | BEA_PCE_Price_Index_Food_services_and_accommodations | Restaurant/hotel inflation |
| **PCE Financial** | BEA_PCE_Price_Index_Financial_services_and_insurance | Financial services inflation |
| **PCE ex-Food/Energy** | BEA_PCE_Price_Index_PCE_excluding_food_and_energy | Core PCE |
| **PCE ex-Food/Energy/Housing** | BEA_PCE_Price_Index_PCE_excluding_food,_energy,_and_housing | "Super-supercore" |
| **PCE Services ex-Energy/Housing** | BEA_PCE_Price_Index_PCE_services_excluding_energy_and_housing | PCE supercore |
| **Market-Based PCE** | BEA_PCE_Price_Index_Market-based_PCE | Excludes imputed prices |
| **Market-Based Core PCE** | BEA_PCE_Price_Index_Market-based_PCE_excluding_food_and_energy | Cleanest core measure |

**Market-Based PCE** is worth watching separately. It strips out imputed components (like financial services consumed without payment). Market-based core PCE sometimes diverges from standard core PCE, and when it does, the market-based version is more "honest" about what consumers are actually experiencing.

## GDP Price Deflators (From DB)

GDP price indices capture inflation at the broadest level of the economy, including investment, government, and trade prices beyond just consumption.

| **Component** | **DB Series** | **Interpretation** |
|---|---|---|
| **GDP Deflator** | BEA_GDP_Price_Index_Gross_domestic_product | Broadest inflation measure |
| **PCE Deflator** | BEA_GDP_Price_Index_Personal_consumption_expenditures | Consumption inflation |
| **Fixed Investment** | BEA_GDP_Price_Index_Fixed_investment | Capex cost inflation |
| **Residential** | BEA_GDP_Price_Index_Residential | Housing construction costs |
| **Nonresidential** | BEA_GDP_Price_Index_Nonresidential | Business construction costs |
| **Equipment** | BEA_GDP_Price_Index_Equipment | Equipment cost inflation |
| **Government** | BEA_GDP_Price_Index_Government_consumption_expenditures_and_gross_investment | Public sector costs |
| **Exports** | BEA_GDP_Price_Index_Exports | Export price inflation |
| **Imports** | BEA_GDP_Price_Index_Imports | Import price inflation |

**When GDP Deflator Diverges from PCE:** If the GDP deflator is running hotter than PCE, it means investment/government costs are inflating faster than consumption. This happened in 2023-2024 as construction costs surged. It signals future consumer-facing inflation as business cost pressures eventually pass through.

## FOMC Projections & the Dot Plot Lens

### Summary of Economic Projections (SEP)

The FOMC publishes quarterly projections for core PCE, which reveal the committee's inflation expectations and reaction function.

| **Metric** | **Source** | **Frequency** | **Why It Matters** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Median Core PCE Projection (Current Year)** | FOMC SEP | Quarterly (Mar, Jun, Sep, Dec) | Near-term inflation view |
| **Median Core PCE Projection (Next Year)** | FOMC SEP | Quarterly | Forward inflation expectations |
| **Longer-Run Core PCE Projection** | FOMC SEP | Quarterly | Should be 2.0% (if not, target shift) |
| **Range of Core PCE Projections** | FOMC SEP | Quarterly | Committee disagreement = uncertainty |

**The Gap Trade:** When market-implied inflation expectations (5Y breakeven) diverge from FOMC projections, one of them is wrong. Historically, the market corrects toward the FOMC's longer-run view. But if the FOMC keeps revising their near-term projections higher (2.6% → 2.8% → 3.0%), it signals they're losing the inflation fight.

## Historical Validation: Pre-Recession Inflation Dynamics

### Pattern Recognition Across Cycles

Inflation behaves **differently** before recessions vs. during mid-cycle slowdowns. Understanding the historical patterns helps calibrate whether current dynamics are "last mile" or "pre-recession."

| **Period** | **Core CPI at Entry** | **What Happened** | **Outcome** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **1990 (Gulf War)** | 5.0% | Oil spike + rate hikes | Recession, core fell to 3.0% over 18 months |
| **2000 (Dot-Com)** | 2.6% | Asset bubble burst, no inflation driver | Mild recession, core stable at 2.5% |
| **2007 (GFC)** | 2.3% | Housing bust → demand collapse | Core fell to 0.6%, deflation scare |
| **2020 (COVID)** | 2.3% | Demand shock, supply chain preserved | Core fell to 1.2%, then massive overshoot |
| **2025-26 (Current)** | 2.6-2.8% | Services sticky, goods normalized | **?** |

**Key Insight:** Inflation typically falls 1-2 ppts during recession as demand collapses. Starting from current core CPI levels, a recession would likely push core to ~1.0-1.5%, which is below target and risks deflation scare. But starting from core PCE at 2.8%, a mild slowdown might only get you to 2.0-2.5%, which is on target. The composition matters: if services ex-shelter remains above 3%, even a recession may not deliver sustained sub-2% inflation given structural forces.

### The Goods-Services Spread as Cycle Indicator

| **Period** | **Goods CPI** | **Services CPI** | **Spread** | **Cycle Phase** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Late 1990s** | -1.0% | +3.5% | -4.5 ppts | Late cycle (wage-driven services) |
| **2003-2006** | +0.5% | +3.0% | -2.5 ppts | Mid-cycle expansion |
| **2015-2019** | -0.5% | +3.0% | -3.5 ppts | Late cycle (globalization offset) |
| **Dec 2025** | +1.4% | +3.0% | -1.6 ppts | **Convergence underway** |

The goods-services spread peaked above 10 ppts in early 2023 (the widest on record) and has narrowed substantially to 1.6 ppts as goods normalized and services decelerated. The convergence happened mostly from both sides: goods came up from deflation, services came down from 7%+. But at 1.6 ppts, the spread is still positive (services > goods), and the question is whether services can break below 3.0% without labor market deterioration.

## Integration with Three-Engine Framework

### Pillar 2 ↔ Pillar 2 (Internal Price Dynamics)

Inflation components create **internal feedback loops**:

```
Shelter Inflation → Wage Demands → Services Inflation →
Inflation Expectations → Shelter Inflation (Reinforcing)
```

The loop intensifies when expectations de-anchor. Current state: **Loop contained but elevated.**

---

### Pillar 2 → Pillar 1 (Labor)

Inflation affects labor through the **real wage channel**:

```
A. Prices → Real Wages → Labor Supply

Inflation ↑ → Real Wages Erode →
Workers Demand Higher Nominal Wages →
Unit Labor Costs ↑ → Services Inflation ↑ (Reinforcing)
```

**Current Linkage:** Track Core CPI vs AHE YoY. When AHE > Core CPI, real wage growth is positive but thin. If inflation reaccelerates, real wages turn negative, intensifying wage demands.

**Cross-Pillar Signal:** When **PCI > +0.5** (elevated inflation) AND **LFI > +0.8** (labor fragility), the Fed faces a **policy dilemma**: cut to support labor (fuels inflation) vs. hold to fight inflation (deepens recession). Check current PCI and LFI readings to assess whether the dilemma is active.

---

### Pillar 2 → Pillar 3 (Growth)

Inflation affects growth through **two channels**: real income erosion and Fed policy response.

```
B. Prices → Real Income → Consumption

Inflation Erodes Purchasing Power →
Real Disposable Income ↓ →
Consumer Spending ↓ → GDP Growth ↓
```

**Current Linkage:** Track real DPI growth YoY. When positive, consumers have purchasing power buffer. When negative, consumption (68% of GDP) comes under pressure.

```
C. Prices → Fed Policy → Financial Conditions → Growth

Elevated Inflation → Fed Stays Restrictive →
Financial Conditions Tight → Investment ↓ → GDP Growth ↓
```

**Current Linkage:** When PCI is elevated (>+0.5), the Fed holds or tightens. This keeps real policy rates restrictive, which pressures GCI with a 2-4 quarter lag.

**Cross-Pillar Signal:** PCI leads GCI by 2-4 quarters. Inflation persistence delays easing, which delays growth recovery. When PCI is elevated → Fed on hold → GCI deteriorates further.

---

### Pillar 2 → Pillar 5 (Consumer)

Inflation is the **primary determinant** of consumer purchasing power:

```
D. Prices → Consumer Health

Inflation → Real Income Erosion →
Savings Rate Compression → Credit Utilization ↑ →
Consumer Stress
```

**Current Linkage:** Persistent inflation erodes purchasing power. Track savings rate (near cycle lows) and credit card balances (at record highs). Consumer cushion depends on real wage growth staying positive.

**Cross-Pillar Signal:** When **PCI > +0.5** (elevated inflation) AND **CCI < -0.5** (consumer stress), the consumer is caught in a **squeeze**: prices rising, income stagnant, savings depleted. Check current PCI and CCI to assess squeeze status.

---

### Pillar 2 → Pillar 9 (Financial)

Inflation affects credit through **two channels**: real rate transmission and inflation uncertainty premium.

```
E. Prices → Credit Spreads

Inflation Volatility ↑ → Uncertainty Premium ↑ →
Credit Spreads Widen → Corporate Borrowing Costs ↑ →
Default Risk ↑
```

**Current Linkage:** Inflation volatility drives credit uncertainty premium. When HY OAS is tight while PCI remains elevated, it reflects consensus complacency. Any inflation surprise widens spreads violently.

**Cross-Pillar Signal:** When **PCI volatility** spikes, credit spreads follow with 1-3 month lag. Track the divergence between PCI regime (elevated) and HY OAS (tight) as a contrarian risk signal.

---

### Pillar 2 → Pillar 10 (Plumbing)

Inflation **determines** Fed policy, which **determines** liquidity transmission:

```
F. Prices → Fed Policy → Liquidity

Core PCE → Fed Funds Rate → Real Rates →
Financial Conditions → Dealer Balance Sheets →
Liquidity Transmission
```

**Current Linkage:** Core PCE determines Fed Funds → Real policy rate → Financial conditions → Liquidity transmission. The Fed **cannot ease aggressively** while PCI > +0.5.

**The Plumbing Trap:** If Fed cuts (to support labor/growth), inflation may reignite → forced to reverse → volatility spike. If Fed holds (to fight inflation), growth crashes → financial stress → forced to cut anyway. **Policy trap.**

**Cross-Pillar Signal:** When **PCI > +0.5** (elevated inflation) AND **LCI < -0.5** (thin cushion), the Fed has **no room** to ease even if growth/labor weaken. Check current PCI and LCI to assess whether the trap is engaged.

## Data Source Summary

| **Category** | **Primary Source** | **Frequency** | **Release Lag** | **FRED Availability** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **CPI** | BLS | Monthly | ~13 days | Same day (CPIAUCSL, CPILFESL, etc.) |
| **PCE** | BEA | Monthly | ~30 days | Same day (PCEPI, PCEPILFE, etc.) |
| **PPI** | BLS | Monthly | ~14 days | Same day (PPIFIS, PPIFES, etc.) |
| **Breakeven Inflation** | FRED/Treasury | Daily | Real-time | Same day (T5YIE, T10YIE, T5YIFR) |
| **UMich Expectations** | UMich | Monthly (prelim/final) | ~12/25 days | Same day (MICH, MICH5Y10) |
| **NY Fed SCE** | NY Fed | Monthly | ~10 days | Web scrape (not in FRED) |
| **SPF** | Philadelphia Fed | Quarterly | ~20 days | Manual download |
| **Sticky/Flexible CPI** | Atlanta Fed | Monthly | ~2 days after CPI | Same day (CORESTICKM159SFRBATL, etc.) |
| **Market Rents** | Zillow, Apartment List | Monthly | ~5-10 days | Web scrape (not in FRED) |

**Critical Timing:** CPI is released mid-month (~13th), PCE end-of-month (~30th). PCE is the **lagging** confirmation of what CPI already told you 2 weeks prior. Use CPI for real-time signals, PCE for Fed reaction function.

**The Shelter Lag:** CPI Shelter data is **12-18 months stale** relative to market rents. Use Zillow/Apartment List for **real-time** shelter inflation signals, then wait 12 months for CPI to catch up.

| **PCI** | *computed from composite* | <+0.5 on target | Master regime indicator |

### Narrative Synthesis Framework

The assessment framework follows a consistent structure. Update readings dynamically.

**Disinflationary Forces (check these for progress):**
- Core goods: Below 2%? Goods disinflation still contributing. Above 2%? Tariff/dollar risk materializing.
- Shelter CPI: Declining toward 3%? Mechanical pipeline intact. Stalling above 3.5%? New lease inflation or supply shock.
- Market rents (Zillow/Apartment List) at or below 3%? Pipeline confirms further CPI shelter decline.
- 5Y5Y forward below 2.3%? Expectations well-anchored.
- PPI below CPI? Disinflationary pipeline. PPI above CPI? Inflationary pipeline.

**Sticky Forces (check these for the last mile):**
- Core services ex-shelter: Below 3.0% = victory. Above 3.5% = structural wage floor.
- Sticky CPI: Below 3.0% historically requires recession. At or above 3.0% = persistence problem.
- ECI total compensation: Below 3.0% consistent with 2% inflation (assuming 1.5% productivity). Above 3.5% = wage floor.
- Core PCE 3M annualized vs 12M: 3M < 12M = improving momentum. 3M > 12M = accelerating.
- Trimmed mean PCE (12M vs 6M): Convergence toward 2% confirms breadth of disinflation.
- Median CPI: The "typical" CPI component. Above 3.0% = broad-based stickiness.

**Cross-Pillar Confirmation:**
- **Labor Pillar (LFI):** Elevated fragility → wage pressure fades → services disinflation with 6-9 month lag
- **Plumbing Pillar (LCI):** Thin cushion → limits Fed's ability to ease even if inflation cooperates
- **Growth Pillar (GCI):** Contraction risk → demand destruction → disinflationary impulse with 9-12 month lag

**MRI Contribution:** PCI feeds directly into MRI. When PCI > +0.5 (elevated inflation regime), it constrains the Fed and pushes MRI toward defensive territory regardless of other pillar readings.

## Invalidation Criteria

### Bull Case (Disinflation Success) Invalidation Thresholds

If the following conditions are met **simultaneously for 3+ months**, the "sticky inflation" thesis is invalidated:

✅ **Core PCE 3M Ann** drops below **2.5%** (on target path)
✅ **Core Services ex-Shelter** drops below **3.0%** (wage pressure fading)
✅ **Sticky CPI YoY** drops below **3.5%** (persistence breaking)
✅ **Shelter CPI YoY** drops below **3.5%** (mechanical disinflation confirmed)
✅ **5Y5Y Forward** drops below **2.3%** (expectations re-anchoring)
✅ **PCI** drops below **+0.3** (on target regime)

**Action if Invalidated:** Fed gains **flexibility** to cut aggressively. Real yields drop. Growth/duration assets rally. Rotate to **cyclicals** (XLY, XLF) and **long-duration** (TLT, tech).

---

### Bear Case (Inflation Re-Acceleration) Confirmation Thresholds

If the following conditions are met, inflation is **re-accelerating** beyond "sticky" into "crisis":

🔴 **Core PCE 3M Ann** exceeds **4.0%** (momentum reversing)
🔴 **Core Services ex-Shelter** exceeds **4.5%** (wage-price spiral resuming)
🔴 **Sticky CPI YoY** exceeds **5.0%** (persistence intensifying)
🔴 **Goods CPI YoY** turns **positive** (deflation reversing)
🔴 **5Y5Y Forward** exceeds **2.75%** (expectations de-anchoring)
🔴 **PCI** exceeds **+1.2** (high inflation regime)

**Action if Confirmed:** Fed **forced to hike** or stay restrictive indefinitely. Growth crashes. Real yields spike. Maximum defensive posture. Overweight **cash** (SGOV), **TIPS** (TIP), **commodities** (DBC). Avoid **all duration** (TLT, tech, crypto).

---

## Structural Inflation Forces (Medium-Term, 3-5 Year Horizon)

These are non-cyclical forces that create a persistent floor under inflation, making the 2010s regime of sub-2% inflation unlikely to return.

### 1. Deglobalization & Supply Chain Restructuring

China's share of U.S. imports has declined from ~22% (2017 peak) to ~14% (2024). Mexico surpassed China as the largest U.S. import source in 2023. Reshoring/friend-shoring to higher-cost locations raises input costs during the transition period. Net effect: modest inflationary tailwind (+0.1-0.3 ppts to goods CPI) for the next 3-5 years until automation offsets.

### 2. Energy Transition

Building renewable capacity is resource-intensive: copper (EVs use 3-4x more than ICE), lithium, nickel, grid infrastructure. Short-run inflationary (commodity demand surge), long-run disinflationary (near-zero marginal cost energy). Timeline: inflationary pressure for ~5-10 years, then deflationary abundance.

### 3. Demographics & Structural Labor Tightness

Prime-age LFPR has recovered to record highs (~83.7%). Total LFPR remains structurally depressed (~62.3% vs 67.3% in 2000) due to Baby Boomer retirements. This creates a persistent labor supply constraint that puts a floor under wage growth even during cyclical slowdowns. The unemployment rate *understates* labor market tightness relative to the 2010s.

### 4. Housing Supply Deficit

Chronic underbuilding since the GFC (2010-2020) created a structural housing shortage of 3-5 million units. Even with cooler demand, rents have a structural floor because vacancy rates are historically low. New construction is rate-sensitive (higher mortgage rates → fewer starts → less supply → rents stay elevated). Shelter inflation will normalize cyclically but won't return to the 1-2% YoY of the 2010s.

### 5. Fiscal Dominance Regime (2025-2026)

$2T+ annual deficits with debt/GDP near 120%. Interest expense has surged from 1.5% of GDP (2021) to 3.5%+ (2024). Every 100 bps of higher rates adds ~$300B in annual interest costs. The fiscal impulse is persistently inflationary at a time monetary policy is trying to be restrictive. This conflict is the macro story of 2026.

**Combined Structural Floor:** These five forces together suggest a **structural inflation floor of 2.5-3.0%** for the medium term (2025-2028). The Fed's 2.0% target may require either accepting higher equilibrium inflation or engineering sufficient demand destruction to offset structural tailwinds.

---

## Four Inflation Scenarios (12-24 Month Horizon)

| **Scenario** | **Probability** | **Core PCE Path** | **Fed Response** | **Market Impact** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **1. Soft Landing** | ~25-30% | Glides to 2.0-2.5% | Gradual cuts to 3.5-4.0% | Equities supported, risk-on |
| **2. Inflation Rekindling** | ~20-25% | Reaccelerates to 3.5%+ | Hike or extend hold | Rates reprice higher, equities correct |
| **3. Hard Landing** | ~20-25% | Undershoots <2.0% | Aggressive cuts | Recession, bear market |
| **4. New Normal (3%)** | ~25-30% | Stabilizes at 2.8-3.2% | Implicit tolerance | Bond yields reprice, multiples compress |

**Base Case Assessment:** Evaluate which scenario is most likely by checking: (1) Core PCE trajectory (3M vs 12M momentum), (2) Services ex-shelter direction, (3) PCI regime band, (4) Cross-pillar signals (LFI, LCI, GCI). The structural forces (deglobalization, demographics, fiscal dominance, housing supply) create a floor that makes Scenario 1 (soft landing to 2%) the hardest to achieve. The "New Normal" scenario where inflation stabilizes near 2.5-3.0% and the Fed implicitly adjusts expectations remains the structural base case absent a demand shock.

## Historical Cycle Comparison Tables

### Inflation Breadth at Cycle Peaks

| Period | Headline CPI | Breadth Characteristic | % Items >3% |
|--------|-------------|------------------------|-------------|
| **2000 Peak** | 3.4% | Narrow (tech-concentrated) | ~35% |
| **2007 Peak** | 4.1% | Mixed (energy-driven) | ~45% |
| **2019 Peak** | 2.3% | Very narrow (below target) | ~25% |
| **June 2022 Peak** | **9.1%** | Extremely broad (40-year high) | **>70%** |
| **December 2025** | 2.7% | Narrowing (shelter-dominated) | ~40% |

At the June 2022 peak, over **70% of CPI components** were rising above normal, the broadest inflation since the 1980s. Current breadth has narrowed significantly, with inflation increasingly concentrated in shelter and select services.

### Fed Easing at Historical Cycle Peaks

| Cycle | First Cut | Inflation at Cut | Easing Style | Outcome |
|-------|-----------|------------------|--------------|---------|
| **2001** | Jan 2001 | ~2.8% headline | Preemptive | Mild recession |
| **2007** | Sep 2007 | ~2.8% headline | Reactive | Deep recession |
| **2019** | Jul 2019 | ~1.8% headline | Preemptive | COVID interrupted |
| **2024** | Sep 2024 | ~2.5% headline | Gradual | TBD |

**Key Finding:** Fed has **never begun sustained easing** with core CPI >3% absent recession. The current cycle, beginning cuts at 2.7% core PCE, has no precedent in post-Volcker monetary policy.

### Cycle Peak Inflation Comparison

| Metric | 2000 Peak | 2007 Peak | 2019 Peak | 2022 Peak | Dec 2025 |
|--------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|----------|
| **Headline CPI** | 3.4% | 4.1% | 2.3% | **9.1%** | 2.7% |
| **Core CPI** | ~2.5% | ~2.4% | ~2.3% | ~5.9% | 2.6% |
| **Goods CPI** | ~2-3% | ~3-4% | ~1.3% | ~14% | ~1.4% |
| **Services CPI** | ~3-4% | ~3.5% | ~2.7% | ~7.3% | ~3.0% |
| **Shelter CPI** | ~3.5% | ~3.0% | ~3.2% | ~7.8% | 3.2% |
| **Fed Funds** | 6.5% | 5.25% | 1.75% | 5.5% | 3.5-3.75% |

---

## Supply Chain & Pipeline Indicators

### Current Supply Chain Status (January 2026)

| Indicator | Current | Peak (2021-22) | Signal |
|-----------|---------|----------------|--------|
| **NY Fed GSCPI** | +0.51 | +4.3 | Normal range |
| **ISM Prices Paid** | 58.5 | 87.1 | Modest upward pressure |
| **Drewry Container Index** | $2,213/40ft | $10,377/40ft | Well below crisis |
| **Baltic Dry Index** | ~1,200 | ~5,600 | Normalized |

Supply chain normalization is **essentially complete**. The GSCPI near zero indicates global supply chain pressures are no longer contributing to inflation. Any goods inflation from here is demand-driven or tariff-related, not supply-constrained.

### PPI-to-CPI Transmission Analysis

| Relationship | Lead Time | Predictive Power | Current Signal |
|-------------|-----------|------------------|----------------|
| PPI Goods → CPI Goods | **1-3 months** | Moderate (R²~0.45) | Neutral |
| PPI Services → CPI Services | Weak | Low (R²~0.25) | Slight pressure |
| Food PPI → Food CPI | **2-4 months** | Strong (R²~0.65) | Benign |
| Intermediate Demand → Final | **3-6 months** | Early warning | Watch |

---

## Dollar & Import Price Transmission

### The Dollar Transmission Chain

```
Dollar Appreciates →
Import Prices Fall (3-6 mo lag) →
Goods CPI Falls (3-6 mo lag) →
Headline CPI Compressed (3-6 mo lag)

Total Chain: ~9-18 months from dollar move to CPI impact
```

A **10% dollar appreciation** typically results in ~1.0-1.5 ppt reduction in goods CPI over 12-18 months.

### Current Dollar Risk Assessment (January 2026)

The **trade-weighted dollar has fallen approximately 10% year-over-year**, with the DXY touching four-year lows near 96 in January 2026. Historically, a 10% dollar depreciation adds 0.5-1.0% to imported inflation with a 6-12 month lag.

**Current Import Price Data:**
- Non-fuel imports: **+0.7% YoY** (benign)
- Import prices from China: **-3.6% YoY** (largest decline since series began 2003)

The Chinese deflation may reverse if tariff policies escalate. Dollar weakness creates **upside risk** to the otherwise favorable import price picture through 2026.

## Academic Research Validation

### Peer-Reviewed Findings Supporting the Framework

**Shelter Lag Relationship:**
- Minneapolis Fed modeling: "Almost two years for new lease prices to pass through to contract rents and CPI"
- Ball & Koh NBER Working Paper 34113 (2025): Model using Zillow data "performs fairly well" in forecasting CPI shelter. Market-shelter gaps close only 25% within 12 months but 81% within four years.

**Sticky Price Predictive Power:**
- Bryan & Meyer (Cleveland Fed): Sticky-price measures reduce forecast errors for 24-month-ahead inflation by approximately **14%** versus headline CPI
- Dolmas & Koenig (Dallas Fed, arXiv 2207.12494v3): Trimmed and median measures produce **20-25% lower RMSE** against current trend inflation and **10-17% lower** for future trend

**Wage-Price Transmission:**
- American Action Forum: Employment cost growth of 4% is consistent with inflation in the 2.5-3.0% range
- IMF research on 79 historical wage-price spiral episodes: "Only a small minority were followed by sustained acceleration." Spirals are rare.

**Goods-Services Dynamics:**
- Bernanke & Blanchard NBER Paper (2023): "Most of the inflation surge that began in 2021 was the result of shocks to prices given wages," not labor market overheating. Supply normalization drove goods disinflation; services remained sticky due to labor intensity and shelter lags.

**Post-Pandemic Regime Change:**
- Boston Fed (2025): Post-pandemic volatility has increased for BOTH sticky and flexible components, suggesting shocks persist longer and spill across sectors, making the "persistent inflation regime" risk higher than pre-pandemic.

## Reference: Published Analysis

**"The Last Mile of Disinflation"** (The Beacon, October 6, 2025) covers the complete narrative arc of the 2021-2025 inflation episode: demand overshoot from fiscal transfers, supply chain amplification, goods-services divergence, the shelter lag trap, wage-services linkage, demographics, deglobalization, energy transition, and the four scenarios framework. See `Outputs/beacon/last_mile_disinflation/` for the full piece with 15 charts.

**"Prices: The Transmission Belt"** (Educational Series, January 2026) is the published article version of this pillar, covering composition over level, the transmission chain (Prices → Fed Policy → Real Rates → Financial Conditions → Asset Prices → Growth → Employment), and the key framework insight that "a headline reading of 2.7% tells you nothing about the underlying regime."

## Conclusion: The "Last Mile" is Structural, Not Cyclical

Inflation isn't a number. It's a **regime**. And the regime has changed.

Pre-pandemic, 2.0% PCE was the equilibrium. Shocks (oil spikes, financial crises) would push it temporarily off-target, but it mean-reverted. That world is dead.

Post-pandemic, the equilibrium has shifted higher. Five structural forces create a persistent floor:
1. **Deglobalization** raising goods costs as supply chains shift to higher-cost alternatives
2. **Energy transition** creating resource-intensive commodity demand before the deflationary payoff arrives
3. **Demographics** constraining labor supply as Baby Boomer retirements depress participation
4. **Housing underbuilding** since the GFC keeping vacancy rates historically low
5. **Fiscal deficits** above 5% of GDP injecting demand that monetary policy is simultaneously trying to restrict

These suggest a **structural inflation floor of 2.5-3.0%**. The 2010s regime of sub-2% inflation required globalization tailwinds, subdued wages, and fiscal austerity. All three have reversed.

The path back to 2.0% requires either:
- Breaking the labor market (quits collapse, unemployment spikes → wage pressure fades), OR
- Fed overtightening into recession (demand destruction → forced disinflation), OR
- Structural supply-side miracle (productivity surge, immigration boom)

**The Framework Says:** Watch composition, not the headline. Track the PCI regime bands. When PCI is above +0.5 (elevated), the Fed is constrained regardless of what headline CPI prints. When sticky CPI is at or above 3.0%, the persistence problem hasn't been solved. When PPI runs above CPI, inflationary pipeline pressure is building. When services ex-shelter remains above 3.0%, the last mile is incomplete.

**The Cross-Pillar Trap:** When PCI > +0.5 AND LFI is elevated AND LCI is thin, the Fed has no good options. Cut to support labor → risk reigniting inflation. Hold to fight inflation → risk breaking the labor market. This is the policy trap that defines the current macro environment.

**Validated Empirical Findings (permanent reference):**
- Sticky CPI predicts core CPI 6 months forward with R² = 0.82 (1980-2025, N=545)
- Flexible CPI predicts with R² = 0.37 (2.3x less predictive)
- PPI Granger-causes CPI (p<0.001 at lag 3-4), bidirectional feedback confirmed
- Trimmed mean PCE produces 38% lower RMSE than headline CPI at 12-month horizon (2005-2024)
- Academic confirmation: trimmed measures produce 10-25% lower RMSE across samples (arXiv 2207.12494v3)
- Shelter CPI lags market rents by 12-13 months (validated across 3 turning points, 2015-2023)
