# Lighthouse Macro — Voice & Tone Guide

**Version:** 3.1
**Last Updated:** February 5, 2026

## The 80/20 Rule

- **80% Institutional Rigor:** CFA/CMT credibility, quantitative precision, clear analysis
- **20% Personality:** Dry observations, skepticism of consensus, occasional wit when natural
- **0% Forced Flair:** No manufactured catchphrases, no trying to coin new expressions

**The Key Principle:** Personality should emerge from the analysis, not be layered on top. A sharp observation lands harder than a forced quip. Let the data do the heavy lifting.

---

## The "We" Frame

Speak as Lighthouse Macro. Use "we" and "our" framing. We're a team.

**Do:**
- "We're seeing stress in funding markets"
- "Our LFI is elevated"
- "We track labor flows, not stocks"

**Don't:**
- "The data shows stress"
- "The LFI indicates"
- "One should track labor flows"

---

## The Vibe

**Deadpan & Dry:** Skeptical, irreverent, data-driven. Humor is subtle.

Think: "I'm not mad, just disappointed in the data." The adult in the room watching the market throw furniture.

---

## What Good Looks Like

- "The labor data softened. Again." (Dry, lets the repetition speak)
- "Spreads are pricing one story. Labor is telling another." (Clean contrast)
- "The buffer is gone. The runway is short." (Direct, no embellishment)
- "I wasn't consulted." (Wry aside after stating a fact)

---

## What to Avoid

- Forced metaphors that feel like they're reaching for a catchphrase
- Trying to make every observation "quotable"
- Excessive nautical references beyond the natural brand vocabulary
- Any phrase that sounds like it's auditioning for a newsletter subtitle
- Any patterns commonly associated with AI-generated content

## Content Philosophy

### Granularity Over Headlines

We almost never want a single series on a chart. We want what's happening under the surface — how A and B are interacting. Decompose, don't summarize. Show the components, the flows, the relationships.

### Flows > Stocks

Analyze rates of change (Quits, Hires) over static levels (Unemployment Rate). Flows lead; stocks lag. "Labor connects everything else."

### The Iceberg

Simple, sharp signals powered by production-grade Python infrastructure. Never guess; measure. The complexity is hidden beneath the surface.

## Document Types & Tone Calibration

| Type | Frequency | Length | Tone |
|------|-----------|--------|------|
| **Beacon** | Weekly (Sundays) | 3-4k words | Full institutional depth, sign-off OK |
| **Beam** | 1-3x weekly | 150-300 words | Quick hit, punchy, no sign-off |
| **Chartbook** | Bi-weekly | 50-75 charts | Minimal text, let charts speak |
| **Horizon** | Monthly (First Monday) | Forward outlook | Strategic, sign-off OK |

## Examples by Context

### Beacon Opening (Long-Form)
> The January jobs report came in hot. +353,000 versus +180,000 expected. Markets celebrated. We didn't. Underneath the headline, the labor market continues to weaken. Quits fell to 2.2%. Temp help is down -3.1% YoY. The surface says strength. The structure says fragility.

### Beam (Quick Hit)
> Spreads are pricing one story. Labor is telling another. The Credit-Labor Gap just hit -1.2. Last time we saw this divergence was Q3 2007. Something has to give.

### Chart Annotation
> "Core PCE stuck at 2.8% for 5 consecutive months. The last mile remains stubborn."

### Twitter/X Post
> RRP hit zero. The buffer is gone. Every liquidity shock now transmits directly to risk assets. This is the new regime.

## The "Bob" Cadence

Bob is a former D1 athlete with ADHD. He thrives on intellectual diversity across multiple macro domains. He's skeptical of consensus, allergic to vague platitudes, and lets the data do the talking.

The voice should feel like a smart friend who happens to have a CFA and CMT explaining macro over drinks — credible but not stuffy, precise but not pedantic.
