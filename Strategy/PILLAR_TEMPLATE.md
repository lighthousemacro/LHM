# PILLAR [N]: [PILLAR NAME]

## The [Domain] Transmission Chain

[1-2 paragraph narrative explaining why this pillar isn't just the surface-level concept, but rather a deeper mechanical process. Identify the core insight that separates our view from consensus.]

```
[Step 1] → [Step 2] → [Step 3] →
[Step 4] → [Step 5] →
[Step 6] → [Step 1] (Reinforcing Loop)
```

**The Insight:** [One sharp sentence capturing the non-obvious truth about this pillar. This is the "why we're different" statement.]

[1 paragraph on why this data type is uniquely valuable. What does it reveal that other data can't? Why should macro analysts care about the raw mechanics?]

---

## Why [Pillar Name] Matters: [Subtitle]

[Opening paragraph: Size the pillar's impact. Quantify it. What % of GDP? What scale of flows? Why is it the marginal driver of something important?]

**The Cascade:**

**1. [Pillar] → [Target 1]:** [Mechanism] ([lead/lag timing])
**2. [Pillar] → [Target 2]:** [Mechanism] ([lead/lag timing])
**3. [Pillar] → [Target 3]:** [Mechanism] ([lead/lag timing])
**4. [Pillar] → [Target 4]:** [Mechanism] ([lead/lag timing])
**5. [Pillar] → [Target 5]:** [Mechanism] ([lead/lag timing])

Get the [pillar] call right, and you've triangulated [what you unlock]. Miss it, and [consequence of getting it wrong].

**Current State:** [2-4 sentence real-time assessment. Include specific numbers with dates. State the regime clearly. Note any divergences or unusual dynamics.]

## Primary Indicators: The Complete Architecture

<!--
TEMPLATE NOTES:
- Organize into lettered subsections (A, B, C, ...) by thematic cluster
- Target 8-15 subsections for thorough pillars
- Each subsection follows the structure below
- All FRED codes must be verified as active
- All data must be free, publicly available, or accessible via TradingView/our existing services
- All series must be in Lighthouse_Master.db
-->

### A. [INDICATOR CLUSTER NAME] ([Brief Descriptor])

[1-2 paragraph narrative: What does this cluster measure? Why does it matter within the broader pillar? What's the key insight?]

| **Indicator** | **FRED Code / Source** | **Frequency** | **Lead/Lag** | **Interpretation** |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **[Indicator Name]** | [CODE] | [Daily/Weekly/Monthly/Quarterly] | [Leading X mo / Coincident / Lagging X mo] | [What it tells us] |
| **[Indicator Name]** | [CODE] | [Frequency] | [Lead/Lag] | [Interpretation] |
| **[Indicator Name]** | [CODE] | [Frequency] | [Lead/Lag] | [Interpretation] |
| **[Indicator Name]** | [CODE] | [Frequency] | [Lead/Lag] | [Interpretation] |

#### Derived [Cluster] Metrics

| **Metric** | **Formula** | **Threshold** | **Signal** |
|---|---|---|---|
| **[Metric Name]** | [Calculation] | [Threshold value] | [What crossing means] |
| **[Metric Name]** | [Calculation] | [Threshold value] | [Signal] |
| **[Metric Name]** | [Calculation] | [Threshold value] | [Signal] |

#### Regime Thresholds: [Cluster Name]

<!--
REGIME LABEL CONVENTIONS (choose appropriate set per cluster):
- Growth-oriented: Crisis / Contraction / Neutral / Expansion
- Risk-oriented: Crisis / Elevated / Normal / Low Risk
- Stress-oriented: Crisis / Stressed / Normal / Strong
- Spread-oriented: Complacent / Normal / Elevated / Crisis
- Supply-oriented: Scarce / Tight / Ample / Abundant
Use consistent labels within a pillar. 4 regimes minimum.
-->

---

## [Pillar Composite Index Name] ([Abbreviation])

### Formula

```
[ABBREVIATION] = [weight1]*z([Component1]) + [weight2]*z([Component2]) + ... + [weightN]*z([ComponentN])
```

### Component Weighting Rationale

| **Component** | **Weight** | **Rationale** |
|---|---|---|
| **[Component 1]** | [X]% | [Why this weight: leading indicator, structural importance, empirical fit, etc.] |
| **[Component 2]** | [X]% | [Rationale] |
| **[Component 3]** | [X]% | [Rationale] |
| **[Component N]** | [X]% | [Rationale] |
| **Total** | **100%** | |

<!--
WEIGHTING NOTES:
- Weights must sum to 100%
- All components are z-scored (mean 0, std 1) before weighting
- Note sign convention: negative z() means higher raw value = lower composite
- Document any backtesting that validated weights
- Note if weights were adjusted from initial estimates and why
-->

### Interpretation

| **[Abbreviation] Range** | **Regime** | **Signal** | **Action** |
|---|---|---|---|
| > +1.5 | [Extreme Positive Label] | [What it means] | [Trading implication] |
| +0.5 to +1.5 | [Positive Label] | [What it means] | [Trading implication] |
| -0.5 to +0.5 | Neutral | [What it means] | [Trading implication] |
| -1.5 to -0.5 | [Negative Label] | [What it means] | [Trading implication] |
| < -1.5 | [Extreme Negative Label] | [What it means] | [Trading implication] |

### Historical Calibration

[1-2 paragraphs: How has this composite performed historically? What were readings at key inflection points (pre-2008, pre-2020, etc.)? Any false signals? What's the track record?]

---

## Secondary Composite Indices (If Applicable)

<!--
Some pillars have multiple composites. Examples:
- Pillar 1: LPI (broad) + LFI (fragility-focused) + LDI (deterioration)
- Pillar 11: MSI (structure) + SBD (breadth divergence)
- Pillar 12: SPI (sentiment) + SSD (sentiment-structure divergence)

Include full formula, weighting rationale, and interpretation for each.
-->

### [Secondary Index Name] ([Abbreviation])

[ABBREVIATION] = [formula]
```

| **Component** | **Weight** | **Rationale** |
|---|---|---|
| **[Component]** | [X]% | [Rationale] |

| **[Abbreviation] Range** | **Regime** | **Signal** |

```

### Key Lead/Lag Pairs

| **Leading Indicator** | **Lagging Indicator** | **Typical Lead Time** | **Mechanism** |
