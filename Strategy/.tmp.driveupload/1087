# SECTION 3: COMPOSITES, FORMULAS & THRESHOLDS

## Macro Risk Index (MRI) v2.0

The master composite synthesizing all 12 pillars:

```
MRI = 0.13*(-LPI) + 0.08*PCI + 0.13*(-GCI) + 0.06*(-HCI)
    + 0.08*(-CCI) + 0.08*(-BCI) + 0.05*(-TCI) + 0.08*GCI-Gov
    + 0.04*(-FCI) + 0.08*(-LCI) + 0.12*(-MSI) + 0.07*(-SPI)
```

| MRI Range | Regime | Equity Allocation | Multiplier |
|---|---|---|---|
| < -0.5 | Low Risk | 65-70% | 1.2x |
| -0.5 to +0.5 | Neutral | 55-60% | 1.0x |
| +0.5 to +1.0 | Elevated | 45-55% | 0.6x |
| +1.0 to +1.5 | High Risk | 35-45% | 0.3x |
| > +1.5 | Crisis | 25-35% | 0.0x |

## Component Formulas

**Labor Fragility Index (LFI):**
```
LFI = 0.35*z(LongTermUnemp%) + 0.35*z(-Quits) + 0.30*z(-Hires/Quits)
```

**Liquidity Cushion Index (LCI):**
```
LCI = 0.25*z(Reserves_vs_LCLOR) + 0.20*z(-EFFR_IORB) + 0.15*z(-SOFR_IORB)
    + 0.15*z(RRP) + 0.10*z(-GCF_TPR) + 0.10*z(-DealerPos) + 0.05*z(-EUR_USD_Basis)
```

**Credit-Labor Gap (CLG):**
```
CLG = z(HY_OAS) - z(LFI)
```
CLG < -1.0: Credit too tight for labor reality

**Market Structure Index (MSI):**
```
MSI = 0.15*z(Price_vs_200d) + 0.10*z(Price_vs_50d) + 0.10*z(50d_Slope)
    + 0.10*z(20d_Slope) + 0.12*z(Z_RoC_63d) + 0.10*z(%>50d_MA)
    + 0.08*z(%>20d_MA) + 0.08*z(%>200d_MA) + 0.07*z(NH_NL_20d)
    + 0.05*z(AD_Slope) + 0.05*z(McClellan_Sum)
```

**Sentiment & Positioning Index (SPI):**
```
SPI = 0.20*z(Put_Call_10d) + 0.15*z(VIX_vs_50d) + 0.15*z(-AAII_Bull_Bear)
    + 0.15*z(-NAAIM) + 0.10*z(-II_Bull_Bear) + 0.10*z(-ETF_Flows_20d)
    + 0.10*z(VIX_Backwardation) + 0.05*z(MMF_Assets_YoY)
```
High SPI = Fear = Contrarian Bullish

**Structure-Breadth Divergence (SBD):**
```
SBD = z(Price_vs_200d) - z(%_Stocks_>_50d_MA)
```
SBD > +1.0: Distribution warning (generals without soldiers)

**Sentiment-Structure Divergence (SSD):**
```
SSD = z(SPI) + z(MSI)
```
SSD > +1.5: Capitulation low forming. SSD < -1.5: Blow-off top risk.

## Consumer Conditions Index (CCI) — 7-Component (Updated Feb 2026)

| Component | Weight | 12M Fwd PCE Corr |
|---|---|---|
| Real PCE YoY | 0.25 | -0.817 |
| Saving Rate | 0.20 | +0.504 |
| Retail Sales Control (RSXFS) | 0.15 | -0.498 |
| CC Delinquency (inv) | 0.10 | -0.114 |
| UMich Sentiment | 0.10 | -0.162 |
| Real DPI YoY | 0.10 | +0.260 |
| DSR (inv) | 0.10 | +0.033 |

## Crypto Liquidity Impulse (CLI)

Three-channel liquidity composite measuring how fast global liquidity transmits into crypto.

**Architecture (3 Tiers, 8 Components):**
- Tier 1: Macro Liquidity Tide (40%) — Global M2 Momentum, DXY 63-Day RoC
- Tier 2: US Plumbing Mechanics (35%) — WALCL, TGA, RRP, SOFR-IORB, HY OAS (inv)
- Tier 3: Crypto-Native Transmission (25%) — Stablecoin supply momentum, BTC ETF flows (20d), Exchange stablecoin reserves

Leverage Regime Filter applied multiplicatively (perpetual futures funding rates). Captures the ~17% of time when crypto positioning dynamics override macro liquidity.

Positive CLI = expanding liquidity transmission. Negative = contracting.

**Key empirical findings:**
- Net Liquidity expanding AND dollar weakening: BTC +34.1% next quarter, 84.7% hit rate
- Both bearish: +0.9%, 41.7% hit rate
- Q5-Q1 quintile spread: +22.1%, t-stat 15.6

**Disclosure:** Architecture, components, and empirical results are public. Exact weights, z-score methodology, and regime filter calibration are proprietary.

# SECTION 4: TRADING & POSITION SIZING

## Engine Convergence Matrix

| Macro | Monetary | Structure/Sentiment | Action |
|---|---|---|---|
| Bullish | Supportive | Confirming + Fear | **Maximum conviction long** |
| Bullish | Supportive | Confirming + Neutral | Normal position |
| Bullish | Supportive | Diverging | Reduce exposure |
| Bullish | Restrictive | Any | No new longs |
| Bearish | Any | Confirming | Maximum defensive |
| Bearish | Supportive | Diverging + Extreme Fear | Tactical exhaustion only |

## 4 Signature Synthesis Chains

1. **Labor to Credit to Equity:** Labor flows (Quits) deteriorate first, credit spreads widen, equity multiples compress. Watch "Silent Deceleration."
2. **Collateral Fragility (Crypto-Treasury Loop):** Crypto is marginal buyer of Treasuries via stablecoins. Volatility forces liquidation.
3. **Plumbing to Asset Prices:** RRP drain, reserve scarcity, dealer SLR constraints, repo spread widening, Treasury auction tails.
4. **Fiscal Dominance (2026 Theme):** Term premium is the "Honest Signal." Must reprice to ~150bps for structural deficits in post-QT world.

## Pillar-to-Trade Mapping

| Signal | Expression | Asset |
|---|---|---|
| LFI > +0.8 | Reduce cyclical equity | Equities |
| LCI < -0.5 | Reduce gross, add cash | All |
| CLG < -1.0 | Credit protection (HY short) | Credit |
| PCI > +1.0 | Short duration, inflation hedges | Rates |
| GCI-Gov > +1.0 | Steepener trades | Rates |
| BCI < -0.5 | Underweight small vs large | Equities |
| HCI < -0.5 | Avoid homebuilders | Equities |
| MSI < -0.5 | Reduce gross exposure | All |
| SPI > +1.5 | Contrarian fade | All |

## Two Books Framework

### Core Book (50-100% of capital)
- Macro + fundamental + technical driven, LONG OR SHORT
- MRI regime multiplier applies to sizing
- 3-6 month catalyst horizon, up to 20% per position
- Can go 100% cash

### Technical Overlay Book (0-50% of capital)
- Pure technical (trend + momentum + relative strength), LONG OR SHORT
- Activated when Core Book defensive (MRI > +1.0)
- Max 10% longs, 5% shorts per position
- Tighter stops (10% longs, 8% shorts)

### Position Sizing

```
Position Size = Base Weight * Conviction Multiplier * Regime Multiplier
```

| Tier | Score | Weight |
|---|---|---|
| Tier 1 | 16-19 pts | 20% |
| Tier 2 | 12-15 pts | 12% |
| Tier 3 | 8-11 pts | 7% |
| Tier 4 | <8 pts | 0% (avoid) |

### Dual Stop System (Core Book)

Every position has TWO stops. Whichever triggers first.

**Thesis Stop:** Revenue declines 3 consecutive quarters, key indicator crosses invalidation, macro regime shift.

**Price Stop:** Price closes below 200d MA (longs), Z-RoC < -1.0, or 15% drawdown from entry.

### Technical Overlay Scoring (12-Point System)

3 components, 4 points each. Minimum 8/12 to enter.

| Component | Points | Measures |
|---|---|---|
| Trend Structure | 0-4 | Price vs 50d vs 200d alignment + slope |
| Momentum (Z-RoC) | 0-4 | Direction, magnitude, trajectory |
| Relative Strength | 0-4 | vs BTC/SPX (multiple timeframes + slope) |

### Perfect Setup Requirements

4+ of 6 elements: trend alignment, momentum (Z-RoC), technical structure, relative strength, macro catalyst, risk/reward >2.5:1

### Technical Guardrails

Signals we monitor, not rules we obey blindly. At extremes, they demand attention.

| Signal | Measures | Context |
|---|---|---|
| Price vs 200d MA | Primary trend | Below = higher bar for longs |
| 50d vs 200d MA | Trend structure | Death cross = weakening, duration matters |
| Relative Strength | vs benchmark | Persistent underperformance is a flag |
| Z-RoC (63d) | Momentum | Extremes (<-1.5 or >+1.5) significant |
| Distance from 50d | Extension | >15% stretched = poor entry |

**Philosophy:** When a signal is screaming, listen. When it's whispering, weigh it.

# SECTION 6: COMMUNICATION & VOICE

## Voice & Tone: The 80/20 Rule

- **80% Institutional Rigor:** CFA/CMT credibility, quantitative precision
- **20% Personality:** Dry observations, skepticism of consensus, wit when natural
- **0% Forced Flair:** No manufactured catchphrases

**Core voice:** Macroeconomist who can talk to traders and teach civilians. Confident but humble. Data-backed, explicitly wrong-able. Dry wit over sensationalism. Simplify without dumbing down.

**The "We" Frame:** Speak as Lighthouse Macro. "We're seeing stress" not "The data shows stress."

**"Strong views weakly held"** with explicit invalidation criteria. If [X] happens, the bearish case breaks. This isn't hedging. It's intellectual honesty.

### What Good Looks Like

- "The labor data softened. Again."
- "Spreads are pricing one story. Labor is telling another."
- "The buffer is gone. The runway is short."
- "The Fed's in a box. They just haven't admitted it yet."

### What to Avoid

- Forced metaphors, trying to make every observation "quotable"
- Excessive nautical references beyond natural brand vocabulary
- **Emdashes. Never. Use commas, periods, colons, parentheses, or ellipses.**
- Semicolons (use commas)
- AI-sounding transitions, over-excited adjectives
- "Cautiously optimistic," "geopolitical uncertainty," "complex constellation of factors"
- "In our view," "going forward," "at the end of the day," "it is important to note"

### Sign-Offs

- **New readers:** "Join The Watch."
- **Existing subscribers (Beacon/Horizon only):** "That's our view from the Watch. Until next time, we'll be sure to keep the light on...."
- Don't overuse the formal sign-off. It loses impact.

### Social Media Promotional Template (Framework-First)

> We tracked [X] indicators across [Y] categories to build our [Pillar Name] assessment. [One sentence on what the pillar measures]. We include explicit invalidation criteria for both directions because the framework can be wrong.
>
> Here's what the data says, what it doesn't say, and what would change our mind.

Framework first. Depth first.

### Bob's Writing Cadence

- Skeptical of consensus, allergic to vague platitudes
- Lets data talk, then adds a dry observation
- Short sentences control rhythm
- Casual precision with occasional slang
- Emoji usage: sparse, purposeful (flame for hot takes, eyes for "look at this")

# SECTION 8: CHART STYLING

## Core Rules

- No gridlines. All four spines visible at 0.5pt.
- Right axis is primary. No tick marks.
- Spine colors: Dark theme `#1e3350`, White theme `#cccccc`
- Every chart: `border: 4.0pt solid #0089D1`
- DPI 200, bbox_inches='tight', pad_inches=0.10
- Always generate both dark and white theme versions

## Axis Configuration

**Dual-Axis:** RHS = Primary (Ocean/Sky), LHS = Secondary (Dusk). Both get last-value pills.

**Single-Axis:** Ticks on RHS, RHS pill only.

**X-Axis Padding:** 30-day left, 180-day right (for pills).

## Data Handling

- Always `dropna()`. Forward-fill quarterly to daily.
- Smooth volatile series with 3-month MA. Don't smooth already-smoothed measures.

## Reference Lines

| Type | Color | Style |
|---|---|---|
| Zero line | Doldrums `#D3D6D9` | Dashed |
| 2% Target | Venus `#FF2389` | Solid |
| 3% Danger | Sea `#00BB99` | Solid |

## Recession Shading

Dark theme: white, alpha 0.06. White theme: gray, alpha 0.12.
