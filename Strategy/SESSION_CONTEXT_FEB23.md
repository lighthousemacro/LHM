# SESSION CONTEXT: FEBRUARY 23, 2026
## Everything From Today + Podcast Prep

**Created:** Feb 23, 2026, 1:00 PM ET
**Podcast:** Tim Pierotti (WealthVest CIO) — Feb 24, 1:00 PM ET (24 hours)
**Wolf Calls:** Tabled for later session

# PART 1: WHAT WE BUILT TODAY

## Track Record Framework (Completed)

Two-tier system established for all future credibility documentation:

**Tier 1: Active Scorecard** — Formal positions with entry prices, dates, targets, stops. Started Jan 15, 2026. Updated each Positioning Update.

**Tier 2: Published Call History** — Every explicit directional call from Substack archive (May 2024 onward). Publication date = entry timestamp. Instrument-specific benchmarks. "Last published view = active view" rule.

## Six Critical Decisions Resolved

1. **Two-tier system** (active scorecard + published call history) — not one messy table
2. **Publication date = entry timestamp** — no backdating, no adjusting
3. **Instrument-specific benchmarks** — GLD vs gold spot, XLP vs SPY, not everything vs SPY
4. **"Bullish/bearish" language only** — no "overweight" without a benchmark portfolio
5. **Gold claim from May 2024** with reinforcement chain documented across 4 timestamps
6. **"Last published view = active view"** — if we said bullish gold and never said sell, it's still active

## Positioning Update #2 (Published Feb 22, 2026)

Key corrections applied before publication:
- SPY price: $689 (not $600)
- Tariff rate: 9.1-14% (not 7%)
- 8 charts generated (dark + white themes)
- All proprietary indicator readings stripped for public version

# PART 2: POSITIONING UPDATE #2 — COMPLETE SUMMARY

## Title: "Two Books Framework: Core Book + Technical Overlay"
## Published: February 22, 2026
## Covers: Jan 15 to Feb 22

### Scorecard Results (Jan 15 → Feb 22)

| Position | Result |
|----------|--------|
| SPY underweight | SPY -0.6%. Correct. |
| XLP overweight | +7.0% absolute, +7.6% vs SPY. Winner. |
| XLU overweight | +7.3% absolute, +7.9% vs SPY. Winner. |
| XLV overweight | Flat. Push. |
| IWM underweight | Flat. Push. |
| VIX bullish | 15.44 → 19.09 (+23.6%). Winner. CLOSED. |
| HY underweight | Structurally intact, early. |

**Score: 4 clear wins, 2 flat, 1 early but intact. Zero losers.**

### SCOTUS Ruling (Feb 20) — The Big Event

- SCOTUS struck down IEEPA tariffs 6-3
- Trump pivoted to Section 122 (15% max, 150-day limit)
- Effective tariff rate: ~17% → 9.1% (SCOTUS alone) → ~14% (with Section 122)
- Refund overhang: $100-175B eventually flowing back to importers
- Consumer price impact: 1.2% → 0.6% (Yale Budget Lab)

**Bob's read:** "Yesterday changed the game. Not the thesis."

### Current Macro Assessment

**Labor (THE anchor):**
- Quits rate: 2.0% exactly (pre-recessionary threshold)
- JOLTS openings: 3.9%, lowest since 2020
- BLS revised 2025 payrolls down 403K
- Long-term unemployment rising, hires-to-quits compressing
- Next JOLTS (early March) = most important data point in framework

**Credit:**
- HY OAS: 288 bps (<300 = complacent)
- Credit-labor divergence widest in over a year
- "Credit is looking at the wrong risk"
- SCOTUS may reinforce complacency short-term (less tariff recession risk)

**Plumbing:**
- RRP effectively zero (sub-$1B)
- SOFR: 367 bps, EFFR: 364 bps
- SOFR-EFFR spread: ~3 bps (well below 15-20 bps distress threshold)
- Regime: Defensive, NOT Disorderly
- "Operating without a shock absorber"

**Rates:**
- 10Y: 4.08%, 10Y-2Y curve: +60 bps
- Term premium building
- Steepener thesis gaining traction

**Gold:**
- Surged above $5,000 on SCOTUS day
- Spot: ~$5,025-5,050
- NEW Core Book position

**Vol:**
- VIX: ~19 (down from ~21 pre-SCOTUS)
- Vol call played out. Not adding new convexity at these levels.
- CLOSED the vol position.

**Market Structure:**
- SPX recovered above 50d MA
- Nasdaq breadth fractured: ~44% above 200d MA vs SPX ~64%
- "Generals without soldiers"
- Breadth must confirm in 2-3 weeks (Nasdaq % above 200d → 55%+) or distribution

### Current Positions (Two Books)

**Core Book:**

| Position | Direction | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|-----------|
| SPY | Underweight | Labor-credit divergence. MRI elevated. |
| XLP | Overweight | Defensive. +7% absolute since Jan 15. |
| XLU | Overweight | Defensive. +7.3% absolute. Also Overlay (10/12). |
| XLV | Overweight | Defensive. Flat so far. |
| IEF (belly) | Overweight | Front-end anchored, less duration risk than TLT. |
| TLT | Underweight | Supply + term premium + deficit dynamics. |
| HY | Underweight | OAS <300 while labor deteriorates. CLG negative. |
| GLD | NEW Long | Above $5,000. Dollar weakening. Fiscal impulse. |
| Cash | 30-40% | Elevated. Penalty for defense still low. |

**Technical Overlay Book:**

| Position | Score | Status |
|----------|-------|--------|
| GLD | 10-11/12 | Active. Trend + momentum + RS all strong. |
| XLU | 9-10/12 | Active. Defensive beta in both books. |

### Key Monitoring Signals

1. **Labor Floor:** Next JOLTS (early March). Below 2.0% quits = "pre-recessionary confirmed"
2. **Tariff Transition:** Section 122 at 15%. Watch for 301/232 replacements. Refund timing.
3. **The One Switch:** SOFR-EFFR spread. Defensive-to-Disorderly at 15-20 bps.
4. **Breadth Window:** Nasdaq % above 200d MA must recover to 55%+ in 3 weeks.
5. **Gold/Dollar:** Sustained above $5,000 with DXY weak = real asset rotation strengthens.
6. **Liquidity Watch:** RRP exhausted. Reserves shrinking. Funding spreads the canary.

### Invalidation Criteria (Both Directions)

**Bullish invalidation (thesis breaks):**
- Quits recover above 2.2%
- JOLTS openings reaccelerate
- Breadth confirms (Nasdaq 55%+ above 200d)
- Credit spreads tighten further with labor confirmation

**Bearish invalidation (gets worse):**
- Quits print below 2.0%
- SOFR-EFFR spread widens past 15 bps
- HY OAS breaks above 400
- Payrolls go negative

- **Wage compression** ("Vanishing Job-Hopper Premium"): Reinforces labor thesis as standalone insight.

# PART 5: PODCAST PREP — TIM PIEROTTI (Feb 24, 1:00 PM ET)

## Who Tim Is
- CIO, WealthVest
- BC connection (Providence College network)
- Explicitly helping Bob build profile
- Engaged with Labor and Prices educational posts
- This is about credibility building, not a sales pitch

## What Bob Has to Talk About

### The SCOTUS Story (Fresh, Timely, Nobody Else Has This Framework)
- "Yesterday changed the game. Not the thesis."
- IEEPA struck down 6-3. Section 122 at 15% max, 150 days.
- Effective tariff: ~17% → 9.1% → ~14% with Section 122
- Refund overhang: $100-175B eventually back to importers
- **The key insight:** tariff wild card got materially smaller, but labor was never a tariff story

### The Labor Story (Bob's Bread and Butter)
- Quits at 2.0% exactly. Pre-recessionary threshold.
- JOLTS openings collapsed to 2020 lows (3.9%)
- BLS revised 2025 payrolls down 403K. Market was colder than anyone thought.
- "The economy we are tracking underneath the headlines has been decelerating for months, and that deceleration is domestic, not trade-driven."
- Next JOLTS (early March) = the test. Below 2.0% = pre-recessionary confirmed.

### The Credit Complacency Story
- HY OAS at 288 bps. Below 300. Complacent.
- "Credit and labor are pricing two different economies."
- Gap widest in over a year. Not since 2007 by some measures.
- SCOTUS may make it worse: less tariff risk = another excuse for credit to stay tight

### The Gold Story (Track Record Play)
- Called bullish gold May 2024 at GLD ~$214. Now ~$468. +119%.
- Reinforced through "Bullion Brilliance" (Mar '25), PU#1, PU#2
- Just added to Core Book at $5,000+
- "If tariff risk is declining, why is gold accelerating?" Two reads: refund impulse as inflationary, institutional rebalancing out of dollar assets.

### The Framework Story (Differentiation)
- 12 Pillars across 3 Engines
- Three distinct outputs: Recession Probability, Warning System, MRI
- "Flows over stocks. We track labor market flows, Fed plumbing dynamics, and credit conditions systematically."
- Not one composite number. Three layers that answer different questions.
- Explicit invalidation criteria. "If X happens, the bearish case breaks."

### The Scorecard (Receipts)
- 4 clear wins, 2 flat, 0 losers since Jan 15
- XLP +7.0%, XLU +7.3% absolute in 5 weeks
- VIX call: +23.6%. Closed.
- "The penalty for being early to defense is still low."

## What NOT to Say on the Podcast
- No proprietary indicator readings (MRI level, LFI, CLG exact numbers)
- No specific position sizes (those are paid content)
- No forward positioning beyond what's published
- Framework architecture is public. Real-time readings are paid.

## Suggested Sound Bites
- "The Supreme Court just removed the biggest unpredictable variable in the macro landscape."
- "The tariff regime was never the core of our defensive thesis. Labor is."
- "Quits at 2.0% is the line. Below that is not a data point. It's a regime confirmation."
- "Credit is looking at the wrong risk."
- "The penalty for being early to defense is still low. The penalty for being wrong-sized on risk is still asymmetric."
- "We would rather show you exactly what we said and when than fabricate a backtest."
